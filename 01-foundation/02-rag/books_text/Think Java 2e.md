vi CONTENTS

Preface
Think Java is an introduction to computer science and programming intended
for readers with little or no experience. We start with the most basic concepts
and are careful to define all terms when they are first used. The book presents
each new idea in a logical progression. Larger topics, like control flow state-
ments and object-oriented programming, are divided into smaller examples
| and | introduced | over the | course | of  | several chapters. |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ------ | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- |
This book is intentionally concise. Each chapter is 12–14 pages and covers the
materialforoneweekofacollegecourse. Itisnotmeanttobeacomprehensive
presentationofJava,butrather,aninitialexposuretoprogrammingconstructs
and techniques. We begin with small problems and basic algorithms and work
up to object-oriented design. In the vocabulary of computer science pedagogy,
| this | book       | uses the “objects  | late”  | approach. |             |          |                |         |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------ | --------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| The  | Philosophy |                    | Behind |           | the         | Book     |                |         |
| Here | are the    | guiding principles |        | that      | make the    | book the | way it is:     |         |
|      |            |                    | We     | break     | down topics | that     | give beginners | trouble |
| One  | concept    | at a time:         |        |           |             |          |                |         |
into a series of small steps, so that they can exercise each new concept
|     | in isolation | before | continuing. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------------ | ------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Balance of Java and concepts: The book is not primarily about Java; it
uses code examples to demonstrate computer science. Most chapters
|     | start | with language | features |     | and end with | concepts. |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ------------- | -------- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --- | --- |

viii PREFACE
Conciseness: An important goal of the book is to be small enough so that
students can read and understand the entire text in a one-semester col-
| lege | or  | AP course. |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Emphasis on vocabulary: We try to introduce the minimum number of
terms and define them carefully when they are first used. We also orga-
| nize | them | in glossaries | at the end | of each chapter. |     |     |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | --- | --- |
Program development: There are many strategies for writing programs,
including bottom-up, top-down, and others. We demonstrate multiple
program development techniques, allowing readers to choose methods
| that     | work     | best for | them.    |                |                    |     |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --- |
|          |          |          | To write | a program, you | have to understand | the |
| Multiple | learning | curves:  |          |                |                    |     |
algorithm, knowtheprogramminglanguage, andbeabletodebugerrors.
We discuss these and other aspects throughout the book and summarize
| our             | advice | in Appendix | ??.         |     |     |     |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Object-Oriented |        |             | Programming |     |     |     |
Some Java books introduce classes and objects immediately; others begin with
procedural programming and transition to object-oriented more gradually.
Many of Java’s object-oriented features are motivated by problems with previ-
ous languages, and their implementations are influenced by this history. Some
of these features are hard to explain when people aren’t familiar with the
| problems | they | solve. |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
We get to object-oriented programming as quickly as possible (beginning with
Chapter ??). But we introduce concepts one at a time, as clearly as possible,
in a way that allows readers to practice each idea in isolation before moving
| on. So | it takes | some time | to get there. |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | --------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
Youcan’twriteJavaprograms(evenHelloWorld)withoutencounteringobject-
oriented features. In some cases we explain a feature briefly when it first
| appears, | and | then explain | it more deeply | later on. |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ------------ | -------------- | --------- | --- | --- |
If you read the entire book, you will see nearly every topic required for Java SE
Programmer I certification. Supplemental lessons are available in the official
Java tutorials on Oracle’s website (https://thinkjava.org/tutorial).

PREFACE ix
This book is also well suited to prepare high school students for the AP Com-
puter Science A exam, which includes object-oriented design and implemen-
tation. (AP is a registered trademark of The College Board.) A mapping
of section numbers to the AP course is available on our website:

| Changes |     | to  | the Second |     | Edition |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
This new edition was written over several years, with feedback from dozens
of instructors and hundreds of students. A complete history of all changes is
| available |     | on GitHub. | Here      | are some | of the   | highlights: |      |                    |
| --------- | --- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------------ |
|           |     | We         | reordered | the      | material | in Chapter  | 1 to | present a more in- |
| Chapters  |     | 1–4:       |           |          |          |             |      |                    |
teresting balance of theory and practice. Chapters 2–3 are much cleaner
now too. Methods are now presented in a single chapter, along with
|          | additional | in-depth | examples.  |       |          |        |       |               |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ------------- |
|          |            | We       | rearranged | these | chapters | a lot, | added | many examples |
| Chapters |            | 5–8:     |            |       |          |        |       |               |
and new figures, and removed unnecessary details. Strings are covered
earlier (before arrays) so that readers can apply them to loop problems.
The material on recursion is now a chapter, and we added new sections
|     | to explain | binary | numbers | and | CodingBat. |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | ------ | ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
Chapters 9–12: Our main goal for these chapters was to provide better ex-
planations and more diagrams. Chapters 9–10 focus more on immutable
versus mutable objects, and we added new sections on BigInteger and
StringBuilder. The other content is largely the same, but it should be
|     | easier | to understand | now. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Chapters 13–17: We balanced the amount of content in Chapters 13–14 by
moving ArrayLists earlier, and we implement the “War” card game as
another example. Chapters 15–17 are brand new in this edition; they
cover more advanced topics including 2D arrays, graphics, exceptions,
|     | abstract | classes, | interfaces, | and | events. |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
Appendixes: We added Appendix ?? to explain documentation comments
and Javadoc in more detail. The other three appendixes that were
present in the first edition have been revised for clarity and layout.

x PREFACE
| About |     | the | Appendixes |     |     |     |
| ----- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
The chapters of this book are meant to be read in order, because each one
builds on the previous one. We also include several appendixes with material
| that     | can | be read | at any  | time: |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ------- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| Appendix |     | A,      | “Tools” |       |     |     |
This appendix explains how to download and install Java so you can
compileprogramsonyourcomputer. Italsoprovidesabriefintroduction

forstudents—andotherdevelopmenttools, includingCheckstyleforcode
|          | quality | and | JUnit     | for testing. |     |     |
| -------- | ------- | --- | --------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
| Appendix |         | B,  | “Javadoc” |              |     |     |
It’s important to document your classes and methods so that other pro-
grammers (including yourself in the future) will know how to use them.
This appendix explains how to read documentation, how to write docu-
|          | mentation, |     | and        | how to | use the Javadoc | tool. |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | ---------- | ------ | --------------- | ----- |
| Appendix |            | C,  | “Graphics” |        |                 |       |
Java provides libraries for working with graphics and animation, and
these topics can be engaging for students. The libraries require object-
orientedfeaturesthatstudentswillnotcompletelyunderstanduntilafter

| Appendix |         | D,  | “Debugging” |          |              |          |
We provide debugging suggestions throughout the book, but this ap-
pendix provides many more suggestions on how to debug your programs.
We recommend that you review this appendix frequently as you work
|       | through | the | book. |          |     |     |
| ----- | ------- | --- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Using |         | the | Code  | Examples |     |     |
Most of the code examples in this book are available from a Git repository
at https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2. Git is a “version
control system” that allows you to keep track of the files that make up a
project. A collection of files under Git’s control is called a “repository”.

PREFACE xi
GitHub is a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and a
convenient web interface. It provides several ways to work with the code:
• You can create a copy of the repository on GitHub by clicking the Fork
button. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, you’ll need to
create one. After forking, you’ll have your own repository on GitHub
that you can use to keep track of code you write. Then you can “clone”
the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer.
• Alternatively, you could clone the original repository without forking. If
you choose this option, you don’t need a GitHub account, but you won’t
be able to save your changes on GitHub.
• If you don’t want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a
ZIP archive using the Clone button on the GitHub page, or this link:
https://thinkjava.org/code2zip.
AfteryouclonetherepositoryorunziptheZIPfile, youshouldhaveadirectory
named ThinkJavaCode2 with a subdirectory for each chapter in the book.
The examples in this book were developed and tested using OpenJDK 11. If
you are using a more recent version, everything should still work. If you are
using an older version, some of the examples might not.

xiv PREFACE

| Chapter  |     | 1           |     |
| -------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
| Computer |     | Programming |     |
The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This
way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineer-
ing, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal
languages to denote ideas—specifically, computations. Like engineers, they
design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs
among alternatives. And like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex
| systems, | form hypotheses, | and test | predictions. |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------ |
An important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. It involves
theabilitytoformulateproblems, thinkcreativelyaboutsolutions, andexpress
solutions clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to
program computers is an excellent opportunity to develop problem-solving
skills. On one level, you will be learning to write Java programs, a useful skill
by itself. But on another level, you will use programming as a means to an
| end. As | we go along, | that end will  | become clearer. |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| 1.1     | What         | Is a Computer? |                 |
When people hear the word computer, they often think of a desktop or a
laptop. Not surprisingly, searching for “computer” on Google Images (https:
//images.google.com/) displays rows and rows of these types of machines.
However, in a more general sense, a computer can be any type of device that
| stores and | processes | data. |     |
| ---------- | --------- | ----- | --- |

| 2   |     |     |     | Chapter | 1   | Computer | Programming |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | -------- | ----------- |
Dictionary.com defines a computer as “a programmable electronic device de-
signed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations
at high speed, and display the results of these operations. Mainframes, desk-
top and laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones are some of the different
| types of | computers.” |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Each type of computer has its own unique design, but internally they all share
the same type of hardware. The two most important hardware components
| are        |     | (or | CPUs) | that perform | simple | calculations | and    |
| ---------- | --- | --- | ----- | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------ |
| processors |     |     |       |              |        |              | memory |
(or RAM) that temporarily stores information. Figure 1.1 shows what these
| components | look   | like. |         |           |            |           |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- | ------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- | --- |
|            | Figure | 1.1:  | Example | processor | and memory | hardware. |     |
Users generally see and interact with touchscreens, keyboards, and monitors,
but it’s the processors and memory that perform the actual computation.
Nowadays it’s fairly standard, even for a smartphone, to have at least eight
| processors | and  | four | gigabytes    | (four billion | cells) of | memory. |     |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- | ------- | --- |
| 1.2        | What | Is   | Programming? |               |           |         |     |
A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a
computation on computer hardware. The computation might be something
mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a poly-
nomial. It could also be a symbolic computation, like searching and replacing
| text in | a document |     | or (strangely | enough) | compiling | a program. |     |
| ------- | ---------- | --- | ------------- | ------- | --------- | ---------- | --- |
The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions
| appear | in just | about | every | language: |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | ----- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |

| 1.3 | The | Hello | World | Program |     |     |     |     |     |     | 3   |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device.
|     |     | Display | data | on the screen, |     | or send | data | to a file | or other | device. |     |
| --- | --- | ------- | ---- | -------------- | --- | ------- | ---- | --------- | -------- | ------- | --- |
output:
Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division.
math:
|     |     | Check | for certain | conditions |     | and | execute | the appropriate |     | code. |     |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- | --- | --- | ------- | --------------- | --- | ----- | --- |
decision:
|     |     | Perform | an  | action repeatedly, |     |     | usually | with some | variation. |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------- | --- | ------------------ | --- | --- | ------- | --------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
repetition:
Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve
ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of small instructions that
look much like these. So you can think of programming as the process of
breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks. The
process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with
| the | electronic | circuits | provided | by    | the     | hardware. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3 | The        | Hello    |          | World | Program |           |     |     |     |     |     |
Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new programming
language is called the “Hello World” program. All it does is output the words
| Hello, | World! | to                         | the   | screen. In         | Java,  | it looks | like      | this: |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------ | -------- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| public |        | class                      | Hello | {                  |        |          |           |       |     |     |     |

|        |        | // generate                |       | some               | simple | output   |           |       |     |     |     |
|        |        | System.out.println("Hello, |       |                    |        |          | World!"); |       |     |     |     |
}
}
| When   | this | program    | runs, | it displays | the     | following: |           |        |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| Hello, |      | World!     |       |             |         |            |           |        |     |     |     |
| Notice | that | the output |       | does not    | include | the        | quotation | marks. |     |     |     |
Java programs are made up of class and method definitions, and methods are
made up of statements. A statement is a line of code that performs a basic

| 4   |     |     |     | Chapter | 1 Computer | Programming |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
action. In the Hello World program, this line is a print statement that
| displays                   | a message | to the | user: |           |     |     |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------ | ----- | --------- | --- | --- |
| System.out.println("Hello, |           |        |       | World!"); |     |     |
System.out.println displays results on the screen; the name println stands
for “print line”. Confusingly, print can mean both “display on the screen” and
“send to the printer”. In this book, we’ll try to say “display” when we mean
output to the screen. Like most statements, the print statement ends with a
| semicolon | (;). |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Java is “case-sensitive”, which means that uppercase and lowercase are not the
same. In the Hello World program, System has to begin with an uppercase
| letter; | system and | SYSTEM | won’t | work. |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
A is a named sequence of statements. This program defines one
method
| method | named main: |      |               |     |       |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- | ------------- | --- | ----- | --- |
| public | static      | void | main(String[] |     | args) |     |
The name and format of main is special: when the program runs, it starts at
the first statement in main and ends when it finishes the last statement. Later,
| you will | see programs | that | define | more | than one method. |     |
| -------- | ------------ | ---- | ------ | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
This program defines a class named Hello. For now, a class is a collection
of methods; we’ll have more to say about this later. You can give a class any
name you like, but it is conventional to start with a capital letter. The name
of the class has to match the name of the file it is in, so this class has to be in
| a file named | Hello.java. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Java uses curly braces ({ and }) to group things together. In Hello.java, the
outermost braces contain the class definition, and the inner braces contain the
| method | definition. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The line that begins with two slashes (//) is a comment, which is a bit of
English text that explains the code. When Java sees //, it ignores everything
from there until the end of the line. Comments have no effect on the execution
oftheprogram, buttheymakeiteasierforotherprogrammers(andyourfuture

TheprogramminglanguageyouwilllearninthisbookisJava, whichisahigh-
level language. Other high-level languages you may have heard of include
| Python, |     | C and | C++, PHP, | Ruby, | and JavaScript. |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ----- | --------- | ----- | --------------- | --- | --- |
Before they can run, programs in high-level languages have to be translated
into a language, also called “machine language”. This translation
low-level
takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. But
| high-level |     | languages | have two | major | advantages: |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | --------- | -------- | ----- | ----------- | --- | --- |
• It is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs take
less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more
|     | likely | to be | correct. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• High-level languages are portable, meaning they can run on different
kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs
|     | can | run on | only one kind | of  | computer. |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------ | ------------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- |
Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages:
interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and
executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the pro-
gram a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.
| Figure | 1.2 | shows  | the structure | of          | an interpreter. |               |     |
| ------ | --- | ------ | ------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- | --- |
|        |     | Figure | 1.2: How      | interpreted | languages       | are executed. |     |
In contrast, a compiler reads the entire program and translates it completely
beforetheprogramstartsrunning. Thehigh-levelprogramiscalledthesource
code. The translated program is called the object code, or the executable.
Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further
translation of the source code. As a result, compiled programs often run faster
| than | interpreted |     | programs. |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ----------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Note that object code, as a low-level language, is not portable. You cannot
run an executable compiled for a Windows laptop on an Android phone, for

| 6   |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 1 Computer | Programming |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ----------- |
example. Torunaprogramondifferenttypesofmachines, itmustbecompiled
multiple times. It can be difficult to write source code that compiles and runs
| correctly | on different | types | of  | machines. |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------------ | ----- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
To address this issue, Java is both compiled and interpreted. Instead of trans-
lating source code directly into an executable, the Java compiler generates
code for a virtual machine. This “imaginary” machine has the functionality
common to desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, etc. Its language, called Java
byte code, looks like object code and is easy and fast to interpret.
Asaresult,it’spossibletocompileaJavaprogramononemachine,transferthe
byte code to another machine, and run the byte code on that other machine.
Figure 1.3 shows the steps of the development process. The Java compiler is
a program named javac. It translates .java files into .class files that store the
resulting byte code. The Java interpreter is another program, named java,
| which is | short for | “Java | Virtual | Machine” |     | (JVM). |     |
| -------- | --------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | --- | ------ | --- |
Figure 1.3: The process of compiling and running a Java program.
The programmer writes source code in the file and uses javac to
Hello.java
compile it. If there are no errors, the compiler saves the byte code in the file
Hello.class. To run the program, the programmer uses java to interpret the
byte code. The result of the program is then displayed on the screen.
Although it might seem complicated, these steps are automated for you in
most development environments. Usually, you only have to press a button or
type a single command to compile and interpret your program. On the other
hand, it is important to know what steps are happening in the background, so
| if something | goes       | wrong | you | can figure | out | what it is. |     |

You can put as many statements as you like in the main method. For example,
| to display | more than | one | line | of output: |     |     |     |

| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ---- | --- |

|        | public     |                            | static   | void main(String[] |        |        | args)     | {          |      |     |
|        |            | //                         | generate | some               | simple | output |           |            |      |     |
|        |            | System.out.println("Hello, |          |                    |        |        | World!"); | // first   | line |     |
|        |            | System.out.println("How    |          |                    |        | are    | you?");   | // another | line |     |
}
}
As this example also shows, you can put comments at the end of a line as well
| as on | lines | all by | themselves. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Phrases that appear in quotation marks are called strings, because they con-
tain a sequence of characters strung together in memory. Characters can be
| letters, | numbers, |     | punctuation | marks, |     | symbols, | spaces, | tabs, etc. |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | --- | ----------- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
System.out.println appends a special character, called a newline, that
moves to the beginning of the next line. If you don’t want a newline at the
| end,   | you can | use                        | print   | instead            | of println: |     |          |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| public |         | class                      | Goodbye | {                  |             |     |          |     |     |     |
|        | public  |                            | static  | void main(String[] |             |     | args)    | {   |     |     |
|        |         | System.out.print("Goodbye, |         |                    |             |     | ");      |     |     |     |
|        |         | System.out.println("cruel  |         |                    |             |     | world"); |     |     |     |
}
}
In this example, the first statement does not add a newline, so the output
| appears  | on  | a single | line: |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Goodbye, |     | cruel    | world |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
Notice that there is a space at the end of the first string, which appears in the
| output | just       | before | the | word cruel. |     |      |     |     |     |     |

| 1.6    | Formatting |        |     | Source      |     | Code |     |     |     |     |
In Java source code, some spaces are required. For example, you need at least
| one | space | between | words, | so this | program | is  | not legal: |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |

| 8   |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 1 Computer |     | Programming |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ----------- |
publicclassGoodbye{
|     | publicstaticvoidmain(String[] |     |     |     |     | args)    | {   |     |
| --- | ----------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- |
|     | System.out.print("Goodbye,    |     |     |     |     | ");      |     |     |
|     | System.out.println("cruel     |     |     |     |     | world"); |     |     |
}
}
But most other spaces are optional. For example, this program is legal:
| public                     | class  | Goodbye | {             |          |     |       |     |     |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------- | -------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| public                     | static | void    | main(String[] |          |     | args) | {   |     |
| System.out.print("Goodbye, |        |         |               | ");      |     |       |     |     |
| System.out.println("cruel  |        |         |               | world"); |     |       |     |     |
}
}
| The newlines | are | optional, | too. | So we | could | just write | this: |     |
| ------------ | --- | --------- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ---------- | ----- | --- |
public class Goodbye { public static void main(String[] args)
| { System.out.print("Goodbye, |            |     |     |     | "); | System.out.println |     |     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
| ("cruel                      | world");}} |     |     |     |     |                    |     |     |
It still works, but the program is getting harder and harder to read. Newlines

| to understand | the | program | and | find | errors | when they | occur. |     |
| ------------- | --- | ------- | --- | ---- | ------ | --------- | ------ | --- |
Many editors will automatically format source code with consistent indenting
and line breaks. For example, in DrJava (see Appendix ??) you can indent
| your code | by selecting | all | text (Ctrl+A) |     | and | pressing | the Tab | key. |
| --------- | ------------ | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | -------- | ------- | ---- |
Organizations that do a lot of software development usually have strict guide-
lines on how to format source code. For example, Google publishes its Java
coding standards for use in open source projects: https://google.github.
io/styleguide/javaguide.html.
You probably won’t understand these guidelines now, because they refer to
language features you haven’t yet seen. But you might want to refer to them
| periodically | as you | read | this book. |     |     |     |     |     |

| 1.7 | Using |        | Escape |           | Sequences |     |     |     |     |
It’s possible to display multiple lines of output with only one line of code. You
| just   | have   | to tell                       | Java   | where | to put        | the line | breaks: |                 |     |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------- | --- |
| public |        | class                         | Hello3 |       | {             |          |         |                 |     |
|        | public |                               | static | void  | main(String[] |          | args)   | {               |     |
|        |        | System.out.print("Hello!\nHow |        |       |               |          | are     | you doing?\n"); |     |
}
}
| The | output | is two | lines, | each | ending | with a | newline | character: |     |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ---------- | --- |
Hello!
| How | are | you | doing? |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Each \n is an escape sequence, or two characters of source code that repre-
sent a single character. (The backslash allows you to escape the string to write
special characters.) Notice there is no space between \n and How. If you add
a space there, there will be a space at the beginning of the second line.
|     |     |     |       |      | \n     | newline      |           |     |     |

|     |     |     | Table | 1.1: | Common | escape       | sequences |     |     |
Java has a total of eight escape sequences, and the four most commonly used
ones are listed in Table 1.1. For example, to write quotation marks inside of
| strings,                | you    | need     | to escape |     | them | with a backslash: |     |           |     |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------- | --------- | --- | ---- | ----------------- | --- | --------- | --- |
| System.out.println("She |        |          |           |     | said | \"Hello!\"        |     | to me."); |     |
| The                     | result | is as    | follows:  |     |      |                   |     |           |     |
| She                     | said   | "Hello!" |           | to  | me.  |                   |     |           |     |

10 Chapter 1 Computer Programming
1.8 What Is Computer Science?
This book intentionally omits some details about the Java language (such
as the other escape sequences), because our main goal is teaching you how
to think like a computer scientist. Being able to understand computation is
much more valuable than just learning how to write code.
If you’re interested in learning more about Java itself, Oracle maintains an
official set of tutorials on its website (https://thinkjava.org/tutorial).
The “Language Basics” tutorial, found under “Learning the Java Language”, is
a good place to start.
One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding how to
solve a particular problem, especially when there are multiple solutions. For
example, there are numerous ways to sort a list of numbers, and each way has
its advantages. In order to determine which way is best for a given situation,
we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally.
An algorithm is a sequence of steps that specifies how to solve a problem.
Some algorithms are faster than others, and some use less space in computer
memory. Computer science is the science of algorithms, including their
discovery and analysis. As you learn to develop algorithms for problems you
haven’t solved before, you will learn to think like a computer scientist.
Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone. For histor-
ical reasons, programming errors are called bugs, and the process of tracking
them down and correcting them is called debugging. As you learn to debug
your programs, you will develop new problem-solving skills. You will need to
think creatively when unexpected errors happen.
Although it can be frustrating, debugging is an intellectually rich, challenging,
and interesting part of computer science. In some ways, debugging is like
detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the
processes and events that led to the results you see. Thinking about how to
correct programs and improve their performance sometimes even leads to the
discovery of new algorithms.

1.9 Debugging Programs 11
1.9 Debugging Programs
It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the
examples as you go. You can run many of the examples directly in DrJava’s
Interactions pane (see Appendix ??). But if you put the code in a source file,
it will be easier to try out variations.
Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should also try to
make mistakes. For example, in the Hello World program, what happens if
you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What
if you spell println wrong? These kinds of experiments help you remember
what you read. They also help with debugging, because you learn what the
error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than
later on and accidentally.
Debugging is like an experimental science: once you have an idea about what
is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis
was correct, then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take
a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have
to come up with a new one.

of code and then perform trial-and-error debugging until it all works. Instead,
start with a program that does something and make small modifications, de-
bugging them as you go, until the program does what you want. That way,
you will always have a working program, and isolating errors will be easier.
AgreatexampleofthisprincipleistheLinuxoperatingsystem, whichcontains
millions of lines of code. It started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds
used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield in The
Linux Users’ Guide, “One of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would
switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.”
Finally, programming sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are strug-
gling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed.
Remember that you are not alone, and virtually every programmer has had
similar experiences. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a friend and ask questions!

At the end of each chapter, we include exercises you can do with the things
you’ve learned. We encourage you to at least attempt every problem. You
can’t learn to program only by reading about it; you have to practice.
Before you can compile and run Java programs, you might have to download
and install a few tools. There are many good options, but we recommend
DrJava, which is an “integrated development environment” (IDE) well suited
for beginners. Instructions for getting started are in Appendix ??.
The code for this chapter is in the ch01 directory of ThinkJavaCode2. See
page x for instructions on how to download the repository. Before you start
the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.
Exercise 1.1 Computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common
English words to mean something other than their common English meanings.
For example, in English, statements and comments are the same thing, but in
| programs | they | are different. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
1. In computer jargon, what’s the difference between a statement and a
comment?
| 2. What | does   | it mean  | to  | say  | that | a program | is  | portable? |     |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | --- | ---- | ---- | --------- | --- | --------- | --- |
| 3. In   | common | English, |     | what | does | the word  |     | mean?     |     |
compile
| 4. What | is  | an executable? |     | Why | is  | that word | used | as  | a noun? |
| ------- | --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --------- | ---- | --- | ------- |
The vocabulary section at the end of each chapter is intended to highlight
words and phrases that have special meanings in computer science. When you
| see familiar | words, | don’t | assume |     | that | you know | what | they | mean! |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- | ------ | --- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
Exercise 1.2 Before you do anything else, find out how to compile and run
a Java program. Some environments provide sample programs similar to the
| example | in Section | 1.3.      |       |          |     |      |         |     |         |

| 1. Type | in         | the Hello | World | program; |     | then | compile | and | run it. |
2. Add a print statement that displays a second message after the Hello,
World!. Say something witty like, How are you?. Compile and run the
| program |     | again. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

3. Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again.
|     | The | new comment | should | not | affect | the result. |     |     |

This exercise may seem trivial, but it is the starting place for many of the
programs we will work with. To debug with confidence, you will need to have
| confidence |     | in your programming |     | environment. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ------------------- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In some environments, it is easy to lose track of which program is executing.
Youmightfindyourselftryingtodebugoneprogramwhileyouareaccidentally
running another. Adding (and changing) print statements is a simple way to
be sure that the program you are looking at is the program you are running.
|          |     | It is | a good idea | to  | commit | as many errors | as you can | think |

of, so that you see what error messages the compiler produces. Sometimes the
compiler tells you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is fix it. But
sometimes the error messages are misleading. Over time you will develop a
sense for when you can trust the compiler and when you have to figure things
out yourself.
Starting with the Hello World program, try out each of the following errors.
After you make each change, compile the program, read the error message (if
| there | is one),   | and then              | fix the       | error. |         |     |     |     |

| Variables |     | and | Operators |     |
This chapter describes how to write statements using variables, which store
values like numbers and words, and operators, which are symbols that perform
a computation. We also explain three kinds of programming errors and offer
| additional | debugging | advice. |     |     |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | --- | --- |
To run the examples in this chapter, you will need to create a new Java class
with a main method (see Section 1.3). Throughout the book, we often omit
| class and | method    | definitions | to keep the examples | concise. |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| 2.1       | Declaring | Variables   |                      |          |
One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to
define and manipulate variables. A variable is a named location in memory
that stores a value. Values may be numbers, text, images, sounds, and other
types of data. To store a value, you first have to declare a variable:
| String | message; |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
This statement is called a declaration, because it declares that the variable
message has the type String. Each variable has a type that determines what
kind of values it can store. For example, the int type can store integers like
1 and -5, and the char type can store characters like 'A' and 'z'.

| 18  |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 2   | Variables | and Operators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --------- | ------------- |
Some types begin with a capital letter and some with lowercase. You will learn
the significance of this distinction later, but for now you should take care to
| get it right. | There      | is no    | such type | as    | Int    | or string. |      |       |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ---- | ----- |
| To declare    | an integer | variable |           | named | x, you | simply     | type | this: |
int x;
Note that x is an arbitrary name for the variable. In general, you should use
| names that | indicate      | what | the | variables | mean: |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---- | --- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| String     | firstName;    |      |     |           |       |     |     |     |
| String     | lastName;     |      |     |           |       |     |     |     |
| int        | hour, minute; |      |     |           |       |     |     |     |
This example declares two variables with type String and two with type int.
The last line shows how to declare multiple variables with the same type: hour
and minute are both integers. Note that each declaration statement ends with
| a semicolon | (;). |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Variablenamesusuallybeginwithalowercaseletter, incontrasttoclassnames
(like Hello) that start with a capital letter. When a variable name con-
tains more than one word (like firstName), it is conventional to capitalize
the first letter of each subsequent word. Variable names are case-sensitive, so
| firstName | is not | the same | as  | firstname |     | or FirstName. |     |     |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | --- | --------- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- |
Youcanuseanynameyouwantforavariable. Butthereareabout50reserved
words, called keywords, that you are not allowed to use as variable names.
These words include public, class, static, void, and int, which are used
| by the compiler | to  | analyze | the | structure | of  | the program. |     |     |
| --------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --------- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- |
You can see the full list of keywords (https://thinkjava.org/keywords),
but you don’t have to memorize them. Most programming editors provide
“syntax highlighting”, which makes different parts of the program appear in
different colors. And the compiler will complain even if one does sneak past
| you and | your editor. |     |           |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------------ | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.2     | Assigning    |     | Variables |     |     |     |     |     |
Now that we have declared some variables, we can use them to store values.
| We do that | with an | assignment |     | statement: |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 2.3 Memory |       | Diagrams  |     |           |         |       |       |          | 19  |
| ---------- | ----- | --------- | --- | --------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | --- |
| message    | =     | "Hello!"; |     | // give   | message | the   | value | "Hello!" |     |
| hour       | = 11; |           |     | // assign | the     | value | 11    | to hour  |     |
| minute     | =     | 59;       |     | // set    | minute  | to    | 59    |          |     |
This example shows three assignments, and the comments illustrate different
ways people sometimes talk about assignment statements. The vocabulary
| can be | confusing | here, | but | the idea | is straightforward: |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | --------- | ----- | --- | -------- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.
• When you make an assignment to a variable, you update its value.
As a general rule, a variable has to have the same type as the value you
assign to it. For example, you cannot store a string in minute or an integer in
message. We will show some examples that seem to break this rule, but we’ll
| get to that | later. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A common source of confusion is that some strings like integers, but they
look
are not. For example, message can contain the string "123", which is made
up of the characters '1', '2', and '3'. But that is not the same thing as the
integer 123:
| message | =   | "123"; |     | // legal |       |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ------ | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| message | =   | 123;   |     | // not   | legal |     |     |     |     |
Variables must be (assigned for the first time) before they can
initialized
be used. You can declare a variable and then assign a value later, as in the
previous example. You can also declare and initialize on the same line:
| String | message |       | = "Hello!"; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| int    | hour    | = 11; |             |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| int    | minute  | =     | 59;         |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 2.3    | Memory  |       | Diagrams    |     |     |     |     |     |     |
Because Java uses the = symbol for assignment, it is tempting to interpret the

Equality is commutative, and assignment is not. For example, in mathematics
if a = 7, then 7 = a. In Java a = 7; is a legal assignment statement, but

| 20  |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 2 Variables |     | and Operators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ----------- | --- | ------------- |
7 = a; is not. The left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable
| name (storage |     | location). |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Also, in mathematics, a statement of equality is true for all time. If
a = b
now, is always equal to b. In Java, an assignment statement can make two
a
| variables | equal, | but | they don’t | have  | to stay | that way:    |     |     |
| --------- | ------ | --- | ---------- | ----- | ------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
| int       | a =    | 5;  |            |       |         |              |     |     |
| int       | b =    | a;  | // a and   | b are | now     | equal        |     |     |
| a =       | 3;     |     | // a and   | b are | no      | longer equal |     |     |
The third line changes the value of a, but it does not change the value of b, so
| they are | no longer |     | equal. |     |     |     |     |     |

Taken together, the variables in a program and their current values make up
the program’s state. Figure 2.1 shows the state of the program after these
| assignment | statements |     | run.        |         |     |                  |     |          |

|            |            |     |             | b       | 5   |                  |     |          |
|            | Figure     |     | 2.1: Memory | diagram |     | of the variables |     | a and b. |
Diagrams like this one that show the state of the program are called memory
diagrams. Each variable is represented with a box showing the name of the
| variable | on the | outside | and | its current | value | inside. |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | ------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | ------- | --- | --- |
As the program runs, the state of memory changes, so memory diagrams show
only a particular point in time. For example, if we added the line int c = 0;
to the previous example, the memory diagram would look like Figure 2.2.

| 2.4 Printing |     |           | Variables |     |     |     |     |     |
You can display the current value of a variable by using print or println.
The following statements declare a variable named firstLine, assign it the
| value "Hello, |           | again!", |     | and display |          | that value: |     |     |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- | --- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| String        | firstLine |          | =   | "Hello,     | again!"; |             |     |     |
System.out.println(firstLine);
When we talk about displaying a variable, we generally mean the of the
value
variable. To display the of a variable, you have to put it in quotes:
name
| System.out.print("The |     |     |     | value |     | of firstLine | is "); |     |
| --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | ------------ | ------ | --- |
System.out.println(firstLine);
| For this  | example, | the          | output | is  | as follows: |        |     |     |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ------ | --- | ----------- | ------ | --- | --- |
| The value |          | of firstLine |        | is  | Hello,      | again! |     |     |
Conveniently, the code for displaying a variable is the same regardless of its
| type. For             | example: |       |     |         |     |         |     |     |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----- | --- | ------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
| int hour              | =        | 11;   |     |         |     |         |     |     |
| int minute            |          | = 59; |     |         |     |         |     |     |
| System.out.print("The |          |       |     | current |     | time is | "); |     |
System.out.print(hour);
System.out.print(":");
System.out.print(minute);
System.out.println(".");
| The output  | of  | this program |     | is shown |     | here: |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ------------ | --- | -------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| The current |     | time         | is  | 11:59.   |     |       |     |     |
To output multiple values on the same line, it’s common to use several print
statements followed by println at the end. But don’t forget the println!
On many computers, the output from print is stored without being displayed
until println is run; then the entire line is displayed at once. If you omit the
println, the program might display the stored output at unexpected times or
| even terminate |     | without | displaying |     | anything. |     |     |     |

| The following            | program        | converts | a         | time of | day      | to minutes:     |     |     |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- | --- | --- |
| int hour                 | = 11;          |          |           |         |          |                 |     |     |
| int minute               | = 59;          |          |           |         |          |                 |     |     |
| System.out.print("Number |                |          | of        | minutes |          | since midnight: | "); |     |
| System.out.println(hour  |                |          | *         | 60 +    | minute); |                 |     |     |
| The output               | is as follows: |          |           |         |          |                 |     |     |
| Number                   | of minutes     | since    | midnight: |         | 719      |                 |     |     |
In this program, hour * 60 + minute is an expression, which represents a
single value to be computed (719). When the program runs, each variable is
replaced by its current value, and then the operators are applied. The values
| that operators | work | with are | called | operands. |     |     |     |     |
| -------------- | ---- | -------- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Expressions are generally a combination of numbers, variables, and operators.
When compiled and executed, they become a single value. For example, the
expression 1 + 1 has the value 2. In the expression hour - 1, Java replaces
the variable with its value, yielding 11 - 1, which has the value 10.
In the expression hour * 60 + minute, both variables get replaced, yielding
11 * 60 + 59. The multiplication happens first, yielding 660 + 59. Then
| the addition | yields 719. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Addition, subtraction, and multiplication all do what you expect, but you
might be surprised by division. For example, the following fragment tries to
| compute                    | the fraction   | of an hour | that | has         | elapsed: |          |             |     |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | --- |
| System.out.print("Fraction |                |            |      | of the      | hour     | that has | passed: "); |     |
| System.out.println(minute  |                |            |      | / 60);      |          |          |             |     |
| The output                 | is as follows: |            |      |             |          |          |             |     |
| Fraction                   | of the         | hour       | that | has passed: |          | 0        |             |     |

| 2.6 Floating-Point |     | Numbers |     |     |     | 23  |
| ------------------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
This result often confuses people. The value of minute is 59, and 59 divided
by 60 should be 0.98333, not 0. The problem is that Java performs integer
division when the operands are integers. By design, integer division always
rounds toward zero, even in cases like this one where the next integer is close.
As an alternative, we can calculate a percentage rather than a fraction:
| System.out.print("Percent |              |           | of the hour  | that | has passed: "); |     |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| System.out.println(minute |              |           | * 100 / 60); |      |                 |     |
| The new                   | output is as | follows:  |              |      |                 |     |
| Percent                   | of the       | hour that | has passed:  | 98   |                 |     |
Again the result is rounded down, but at least now it’s approximately correct.
| 2.6 | Floating-Point |     | Numbers |     |     |     |
| --- | -------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
A more general solution is to use floating-point numbers, which represent
values with decimal places. In Java, the default floating-point type is called
double, which is short for “double-precision”. You can create double variables
and assign values to them the same way we did for the other types:
| double | pi;      |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pi =   | 3.14159; |     |     |     |     |     |
Java performs floating-point division when one or more operands are double
| values.                    | So we can solve | the problem | from the    | previous           | section:        |     |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --- |
| double                     | minute          | = 59.0;     |             |                    |                 |     |
| System.out.print("Fraction |                 |             | of the hour | that               | has passed: "); |     |
| System.out.println(minute  |                 |             | / 60.0);    |                    |                 |     |
| The output                 | is shown        | here:       |             |                    |                 |     |
| Fraction                   | of the          | hour that   | has passed: | 0.9833333333333333 |                 |     |
Although floating-point numbers are useful, they can be a source of confusion.
For example, Java distinguishes the integer value 1 from the floating-point
value 1.0, even though they seem to be the same number. They belong to

| 24  |     |     |     |     | Chapter | 2   | Variables | and Operators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --------- | ------------- |
different data types, and strictly speaking, you are not allowed to make as-
| signments | between | types. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The following is illegal because the variable on the left is an int and the value
| on the right | is     | a double: |          |     |       |     |     |     |
| ------------ | ------ | --------- | -------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| int x        | = 1.1; | //        | compiler |     | error |     |     |     |
It is easy to forget this rule, because in many cases Java converts
automatically
| from one | type | to another: |           |     |     |       |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| double   | y    | = 1;        | // legal, | but | bad | style |     |     |
The preceding example should be illegal, but Java allows it by converting the
intvalue1tothedoublevalue1.0automatically. Thisleniencyisconvenient,
| but it often | causes | problems |       | for beginners. |         | For example: |     |     |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ----- | -------------- | ------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
| double       | y      | = 1 /    | 3; // | common         | mistake |              |     |     |
You might expect the variable y to get the value 0.333333, which is a legal
floating-point value. But instead it gets the value 0.0. The expression on the
right divides two integers, so Java does integer division, which yields the int
| value 0. | Converted | to  | double, | the | value | assigned | to y is | 0.0. |
| -------- | --------- | --- | ------- | --- | ----- | -------- | ------- | ---- |
One way to solve this problem (once you figure out the bug) is to make the
right-hand side a floating-point expression. The following sets y to 0.333333,
as expected:
| double | y   | = 1.0 | / 3.0; | //  | correct |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ----- | ------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
As a matter of style, you should always assign floating-point values to floating-
point variables. The compiler won’t make you do it, but you never know when
| a simple     | mistake | will | come   | back and | haunt | you. |     |     |

| 2.7 Rounding |         |      | Errors |          |       |      |     |     |
Most floating-point numbers are only approximately correct. Some numbers,
like reasonably sized integers, can be represented exactly. But repeating frac-
tions, like 1/3, and irrational numbers, like π, cannot. To represent these
numbers, computers have to round off to the nearest floating-point number.

| 2.8 Operators |     | for | Strings |     |     |     |     |     | 25  |
| ------------- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The difference between the number we want and the floating-point number
we get is called rounding error. For example, the following two statements
| should                 | be equivalent: |           |       |        |       |          |     |         |     |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | -------- | --- | ------- | --- |
| System.out.println(0.1 |                |           |       | *      | 10);  |          |     |         |     |
| System.out.println(0.1 |                |           |       | +      | 0.1 + | 0.1 +    | 0.1 | + 0.1   |     |
|                        |                |           | + 0.1 | +      | 0.1 + | 0.1 +    | 0.1 | + 0.1); |     |
| But on                 | many           | machines, | the   | output | is as | follows: |     |         |     |
1.0
0.9999999999999999
The problem is that 0.1 is a repeating fraction when converted into binary. So
its floating-point representation stored in memory is only approximate. When
| we add | up the | approximations, |     | the | rounding | errors |     | accumulate. |     |
| ------ | ------ | --------------- | --- | --- | -------- | ------ | --- | ----------- | --- |
For many applications (like computer graphics, encryption, statistical anal-
ysis, and multimedia rendering), floating-point arithmetic has benefits that
outweigh the costs. But if you need precision, use integers instead.
absolute
| For example, |         | consider | a bank    | account | with         | a balance |          | of $123.45: |     |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- | -------- | ----------- | --- |
| double       | balance |          | = 123.45; |         | // potential |           | rounding | error       |     |
In this example, balances will become inaccurate over time as the variable is
used in arithmetic operations like deposits and withdrawals. The result would
be angry customers and potential lawsuits. You can avoid the problem by
| representing | the     | balance | as     | an integer: |          |        |     |          |     |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- | ------ | --- | -------- | --- |
| int          | balance | =       | 12345; |             | // total | number |     | of cents |     |
This solution works as long as the number of cents doesn’t exceed the largest
| int, which | is        | about | 2 billion. |         |     |     |     |     |     |

| 2.8        | Operators |       | for        | Strings |     |     |     |     |     |
In general, you cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even if
the strings look like numbers. The following expressions are illegal:
| "Hello" | -   | 1   | "World" | /   | 123 | "Hello" |     | * "World" |     |
| ------- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --------- | --- |

| 26  |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 2 Variables | and Operators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ----------- | ------------- |
The + operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect. For
strings, the + operator performs concatenation, which means joining end-to-
end. So "Hello, " + "World!" yields the string "Hello, World!".

Since addition is defined for both numbers and strings, Java performs auto-

|       | System.out.println(1       |     |         | + 2 + "Hello"); |         |     |     |
|       | // the output              | is  | 3Hello  |                 |         |     |     |
|       | System.out.println("Hello" |     |         | +               | 1 + 2); |     |     |
|       | // the output              | is  | Hello12 |                 |         |     |     |
Java executes these operations from left to right. In the first line, 1 + 2 is
3, and 3 + "Hello" is "3Hello". But in the second line, "Hello" + 1 is
| "Hello1", | and | "Hello1" | +   | 2 is "Hello12". |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | -------- | --- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
When more than one operator appears in an expression, they are evaluated
according to the operations. Generally speaking, Java evaluates
|     |     | order | of  |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
operators from left to right (as you saw in the previous section). But for
| numeric | operators, | Java | follows | mathematical |     | conventions: |     |
| ------- | ---------- | ---- | ------- | ------------ | --- | ------------ | --- |
• Multiplication and division take “precedence” over addition and subtrac-
tion, which means they happen first. So 1 + 2 * 3 yields 7, not 9, and
|     | 2 + 4 | / 2 yields | 4, not | 3.  |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• If the operators have the same precedence, they are evaluated from left
to right. So in the expression minute * 100 / 60, the multiplication
happens first; if the value of minute is 59, we get 5900 / 60, which
yields 98. If these same operations had gone from right to left, the result
|     | would | have been | 59 * | 1, which | is incorrect. |     |     |
| --- | ----- | --------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | --- | --- |
• Anytime you want to override the order of operations (or you are not
sure what it is) you can use parentheses. Expressions in parentheses are
evaluated first, so (1 + 2) * 3 is 9. You can also use parentheses to
make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even
|     | though | it doesn’t | change | the result. |     |     |     |

| 2.9 | Compiler | Error | Messages |     |     |     | 27  |
| --- | -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
See the official Java tutorials for a complete table of operator precedence
(https://thinkjava.org/operators). If the order of operations is not obvi-
ous when looking at an expression, you can always add parentheses to make it
more clear. But over time, you should internalize these kinds of details about
| the | Java language. |     |       |          |     |     |     |
| --- | -------------- | --- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.9 | Compiler       |     | Error | Messages |     |     |     |
Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: compile-time errors, run-time
errors, and logic errors. It is useful to distinguish among them in order to
| track | them down | more | quickly. |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --------- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Compile-time errors occur when you violate the rules of the Java language.
For example, parentheses and braces have to come in matching pairs. So
(1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is not. In the latter case, the program cannot be
| compiled, | and | the compiler | displays | a   | “syntax | error”. |     |
| --------- | --- | ------------ | -------- | --- | ------- | ------- | --- |
Error messages from the compiler usually indicate where in the program the
error occurred. Sometimes they can tell you exactly what the error is. As an
example, let’s get back to the Hello World program from Section 1.3:
| public | class                      | Hello    | {    |               |        |           |     |
| ------ | -------------------------- | -------- | ---- | ------------- | ------ | --------- | --- |
|        | public                     | static   | void | main(String[] |        | args) {   |     |
|        | //                         | generate | some | simple        | output |           |     |
|        | System.out.println("Hello, |          |      |               |        | World!"); |     |
}
}
If you forget the semicolon at the end of the print statement, you might get
| an error | message    | like     | this:  |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File:    | Hello.java |          | [line: | 5]  |     |     |     |
| Error:   | ';'        | expected |        |     |     |     |     |
That’s pretty good: the location of the error is correct, and the error message
tells you what’s wrong. But error messages are not always easy to understand.
Sometimes the compiler reports the place in the program where the error was

| 28  |     |     |     | Chapter | 2 Variables | and Operators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | ------------- |
detected, not where it actually occurred. And sometimes the description of the
| problem | is more | confusing | than | helpful. |     |     |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- |
For example, if you forget the closing brace at the end of main (line 6), you
| might  | get a message | like | this:   |       |         |     |
| ------ | ------------- | ---- | ------- | ----- | ------- | --- |
| File:  | Hello.java    |      | [line:  | 7]    |         |     |
| Error: | reached       | end  | of file | while | parsing |     |
There are two problems here. First, the error message is written from the com-
piler’s point of view, not yours. is the process of reading a program
Parsing
before translating; if the compiler gets to the end of the file while still parsing,
that means something was omitted. But the compiler doesn’t know what. It
also doesn’t know where. The compiler discovers the error at the end of the
program (line 7), but the missing brace should be on the previous line.
Error messages contain useful information, so you should make an effort to
read and understand them. But don’t take them too literally. During the first
few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time
tracking down syntax and other compile-time errors. As you gain experience,
| you will | make fewer | mistakes | and | find      | them more quickly. |     |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | --- | --------- | ------------------ | --- |
| 2.10     | Other      | Types    |     | of Errors |                    |     |
The second type of error is a error, so-called because it does not
run-time
appear until after the program has started running. In Java, these errors occur
while the interpreter is executing byte code and something goes wrong. These
errorsarealsocalled“exceptions” becausetheyusuallyindicatethatsomething
| unexpected | has | happened. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Run-time errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few
chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. When a run-time
error occurs, the program “crashes” (terminates) and displays an error message
that explains what happened and where. For example, if you accidentally
| divide | by zero, you | will | get a message | like | this: |     |
| ------ | ------------ | ---- | ------------- | ---- | ----- | --- |
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
|     | at Hello.main(Hello.java:5) |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

2.11 Vocabulary 29
Error messages are very useful for debugging. The first line includes the name
of the exception, ArithmeticException, and a message that indicates more
specifically what happened, division by zero. The next line shows the method
where the error occurred; Hello.main indicates the method main in the class
Hello. It also reports the file where the method is defined, Hello.java, and
the line number where the error occurred, 5.
The third type of error is a logic error. If your program has a logic error, it
will compile and run without generating error messages, but it will not do the
right thing. Instead, it will do exactly what you told it to do. For example,
here is a version of the Hello World program with a logic error:
public class Hello {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, ");
System.out.println("World!");
}
}
This program compiles and runs just fine, but the output is as follows:
Hello,
World!
Assuming that we wanted the output on one line, this is not correct. The
problem is that the first line uses println, when we probably meant to use
print (see the “Goodbye, cruel world” example of Section 1.5).
Identifying logic errors can be hard because you have to work backward, look-
ing at the output of the program, trying to figure out why it is doing the wrong
thing, and how to make it do the right thing. Usually, the compiler and the
interpreter can’t help you, since they don’t know what the right thing is.
2.11 Vocabulary
variable: A named storage location for values. All variables have a type,
which is declared when the variable is created.

30 Chapter 2 Variables and Operators
value: A number, string, or other data that can be stored in a variable. Every
value belongs to a type (e.g., int or String).
type: Mathematically speaking, a set of values. The type of a variable deter-
mines which values it can have.
declaration: A statement that creates a new variable and specifies its type.
keyword: A reserved word used by the compiler to analyze programs. You
cannot use keywords (like public, class, and void) as variable names.
assignment: A statement that gives a value to a variable.
initialize: To assign a variable for the first time.
state: The variables in a program and their current values.
memory diagram: A graphical representation of the state of a program at
a point in time.
operator: A symbol that represents a computation like addition, multiplica-
tion, or string concatenation.
operand: One of the values on which an operator operates. Most operators
in Java require two operands.
expression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that repre-
sents a single value. Expressions also have types, as determined by their
operators and operands.
floating-point: A data type that represents numbers with an integer part
and a fractional part. In Java, the default floating-point type is double.
rounding error: The difference between the number we want to represent
and the nearest floating-point number.
concatenate: To join two values, often strings, end to end.
order of operations: Therulesthatdetermineinwhatorderexpressionsare
evaluated. Also known as “operator precedence”.
compile-time error: An error in the source code that makes it impossible
to compile. Also called a “syntax error”.

Start with a program that compiles and runs correctly. One player looks
away, while the other player adds an error to the program. Then the first
player tries to find and fix the error. You get two points if you find the error
without compiling the program, one point if you find it using the compiler,
| and your opponent | gets | a point  | if you | don’t    | find it.      |                      |     |

to display values with different types (int and String), and (2) to practice
developing programs gradually by adding a few statements at a time.
1. Create a new program named Date.java. Copy or type in something like
the Hello World program and make sure you can compile and run it.
2. Following the example in Section 2.4, write a program that creates vari-
ables named day, date, month, and year. The variable day will contain
the day of the week (like Friday), and date will contain the day of the
month (like the 13th). Assign values to those variables that represent
| today’s | date. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

4. Calculate and display the number of seconds remaining in the day.
5. Calculate and display the percentage of the day that has passed. You

| Input   | and | Output |     |     |
The programs you’ve looked at so far simply display messages, which doesn’t
really involve that much computation. This chapter shows you how to read
input from the keyboard, use that input to calculate a result, and then format
| that result | for output. |       |     |     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| 3.1         | The System  | Class |     |     |
We have been using System.out.println for a while, but you might not
have thought about what it means. System is a class that provides methods
related to the “system”, or environment, where programs run. It also pro-
vides System.out, which is a special value that has additional methods (like
| println) | for displaying | output. |     |     |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- | --- | --- |
In fact, we can use System.out.println to display the value of System.out:
System.out.println(System.out);
| The result | is shown | here: |     |     |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- |
java.io.PrintStream@685d72cd
This output indicates that System.out is a PrintStream, which is defined in a
package called java.io. A package is a collection of related classes; java.io
| contains | classes for I/O | which stands | for “input and | output”. |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------- |

| 34  |     |     |     | Chapter | 3 Input | and Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
The numbers and letters after the @ sign are the address of System.out,
represented as a hexadecimal (base 16) number. The address of a value is
its location in the computer’s memory, which might be different on different
computers. In this example, the address is 685d72cd, but if you run the same
| code, you | will likely | get something |     | else. |     |     |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
As shown in Figure 3.1, System is defined in a file called System.java, and
PrintStream is defined in PrintStream.java. These files are part of the Java
library, which is an extensive collection of classes that you can use in your
programs. The source code for these classes is usually included with the com-
| piler (see | Section | ??). |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Figure 3.1: System.out.println refers to the out variable of the System
class, which is a PrintStream that provides a method called println.
| 3.2 | The Scanner |     | Class |     |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
The System class also provides the special value System.in, which is an
InputStream that has methods for reading input from the keyboard. These
methods are not convenient to use, but fortunately Java provides other classes
| that make | it easy | to handle | common | input tasks. |     |     |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------ | ------------ | --- | --- |
For example, Scanner is a class that provides methods for inputting words,
numbers, and other data. Scanner is provided by java.util, which is a
package that contains various “utility classes”. Before you can use Scanner,
| you have | to import | it like | this: |     |     |     |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |

| 3.2    | The Scanner        | Class |       |              |     |      |                |             | 35  |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ------------ | --- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- | --- |
| import | java.util.Scanner; |       |       |              |     |      |                |             |     |
| This   |                    |       | tells | the compiler |     | that | when you refer | to Scanner, |     |
|        | import statement   |       |       |              |     |      |                |             |     |
you mean the one defined in java.util. Using an import statement is neces-
sary because there might be another class named Scanner in another package.
Next you have to initialize the Scanner. This line declares a Scanner variable
named in and creates a Scanner that reads input from System.in:
| Scanner | in = | new | Scanner(System.in); |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---- | --- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The Scanner class provides a method called nextLine that reads a line of
input from the keyboard and returns a String. Here’s a complete example
| that   | reads two lines         | and              | repeats | them                | back       | to the | user:      |     |     |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | --- | --- |
| import | java.util.Scanner;      |                  |         |                     |            |        |            |     |     |

Import statements can’t be inside a class definition. By convention, they are
usually at the beginning of the file. If you omit the import statement, you get
a compiler error like “cannot find symbol”. That means the compiler doesn’t
| know | where to find | the | definition | for | Scanner. |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------------- | --- | ---------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
You might wonder why we can use the System class without importing it.
System belongs to the java.lang package, which is imported automatically.

According to the documentation, java.lang “provides classes that are funda-
mental to the design of the Java programming language.” The String class is
| also part | of java.lang. |          |     |     |     |     |

| 3.3       | Language      | Elements |     |     |     |     |
At this point, we have seen nearly all of the organizational units that make up
Java programs. Figure 3.2 shows how these “language elements” are related.
Figure 3.2: Elements of the Java language, from largest to smallest.
Java applications are typically organized into packages (like java.io and
java.util) that include multiple classes (like PrintStream and Scanner).
Each class defines its own methods (like println and nextLine), and each
| method | is a sequence | of statements. |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Each statement performs one or more computations, depending on how many
expressions it has, and each expression represents a single value to compute.
For example, the assignment statement hours = minutes / 60.0; contains
| a single | expression: | minutes | / 60.0. |     |     |     |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
Tokens are the most basic elements of a program, including numbers, vari-
able names, operators, keywords, parentheses, braces, and semicolons. In the
previous example, the tokens are hours, =, minutes, /, 60.0, and ; (spaces
| are ignored | by the | compiler). |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 3.4 Literals | and | Constants |     |     |     | 37  |
| ------------ | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Knowing this terminology is helpful, because error messages often say things
like “not a statement” or “illegal start of expression” or “unexpected token”.
Comparing Java to English, statements are complete sentences, expressions
are phrases, and tokens are individual words and punctuation marks.
Note there is a big difference between the Java language, which defines the
elements in Figure 3.2, and the Java library, which provides the built-in classes
that you can import. For example, the keywords public and class are part
of the Java language, but the names PrintStream and Scanner are not.
| The standard | edition | of Java | comes with |     | classes you | can use, |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --- | ----------- | -------- |
several thousand
which can be both exciting and intimidating. You can browse this library
on Oracle’s website (https://thinkjava.org/apidoc). Interestingly, most
| of the Java | library is | written       | in Java. |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.4         | Literals   | and Constants |          |     |     |     |
Although most of the world has adopted the metric system for weights and
measures, some countries are stuck with imperial units. For example, when
talking with friends in Europe about the weather, people in the United States
might have to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back. Or they might
| want to | convert height | in inches | to centimeters. |     |     |     |
| ------- | -------------- | --------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
We can write a program to help. We’ll use a Scanner to input a measurement
in inches, convert to centimeters, and then display the results. The following
| lines declare | the variables | and | create the | Scanner: |     |     |
| ------------- | ------------- | --- | ---------- | -------- | --- | --- |
int inch;
| double  | cm;      |                     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scanner | in = new | Scanner(System.in); |     |     |     |     |
The next step is to prompt the user for the input. We’ll use print instead of
println so the user can enter the input on the same line as the prompt. And
we’ll use the Scanner method nextInt, which reads input from the keyboard
| and converts          | it to an        | integer: |              |     |     |     |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
| System.out.print("How |                 |          | many inches? | "); |     |     |
| inch                  | = in.nextInt(); |          |              |     |     |     |

| 38  |     |     |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 3 Input | and Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ------- | ---------- |
Next we multiply the number of inches by 2.54, since that’s how many cen-
| timeters              | there | are per inch, |     | and display | the   | results: |     |     |     |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| cm =                  | inch  | * 2.54;       |     |             |       |          |     |     |     |
| System.out.print(inch |       |               |     | + " in      | = "); |          |     |     |     |
| System.out.println(cm |       |               |     | + " cm");   |       |          |     |     |     |
This code works correctly, but it has a minor problem. If another programmer
reads this code, they might wonder where 2.54 comes from. For the benefit of
others (and yourself in the future), it would be better to assign this value to
| a variable | with | a meaningful |     | name. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A value that appears in a program, like the number 2.54, is called a literal.
In general, there’s nothing wrong with literals. But when numbers like 2.54
appear in an expression with no explanation, they make the code hard to read.
And if the same value appears many times and could change in the future, it
| makes  | the code  | hard to       | maintain. |        |       |         |     |       |                 |
| ------ | --------- | ------------- | --------- | ------ | ----- | ------- | --- | ----- | --------------- |
| Values | like 2.54 | are sometimes |           | called |       |         |     | (with | the implication |
|        |           |               |           |        | magic | numbers |     |       |                 |
that being magic is not a good thing). A good practice is to assign magic
| numbers | to variables | with         | meaningful |     | names, | like | this: |     |     |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | --- | ------ | ---- | ----- | --- | --- |
| double  | cmPerInch    |              | = 2.54;    |     |        |      |       |     |     |
| cm =    | inch         | * cmPerInch; |            |     |        |      |       |     |     |
This version is easier to read and less error-prone, but it still has a problem.
Variables can vary (hence the term), but the number of centimeters in an inch
does not. Once we assign a value to cmPerInch, it should never change. Java
provides the keyword final, a language feature that enforces this rule:
| final | double | CM_PER_INCH |     | =   | 2.54; |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Declaring that a variable is final means that it cannot be reassigned once it
| has been | initialized. | If  | you try, | the | compiler | gives | an  | error. |     |
| -------- | ------------ | --- | -------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | ------ | --- |
Variables declared as final are called constants. By convention, names for
constants are all uppercase, with the underscore character (_) between words.

| 3.5            | Formatting |        |     | Output |     |     |     |     |
When you output a double by using print or println, it displays up to 16
| decimal              | places: |                |     |         |     |     |     |     |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| System.out.print(4.0 |         |                |     | / 3.0); |     |     |     |     |
| The result           |         | is as follows: |     |         |     |     |     |     |
1.3333333333333333
That might be more than you want. System.out provides another method,
called printf, that gives you more control of the format. The “f” in printf
| stands                  | for “formatted”. |     | Here’s | an example: |          |     |             |     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | -------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
| System.out.printf("Four |                  |     |        | thirds      | = %.3f", |     | 4.0 / 3.0); |     |
The first value in the parentheses is a that specifies how the
|     |     |     |     |     | format | string |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- |
output should be displayed. This format string contains ordinary text followed
by a format specifier, which is a special sequence that starts with a percent
sign. The format specifier %.3f indicates that the following value should be
| displayed | as     | floating-point, |     | rounded | to three | decimal | places: |     |
| --------- | ------ | --------------- | --- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| Four      | thirds | = 1.333         |     |         |          |         |         |     |
The format string can contain any number of format specifiers; here’s an ex-
| ample                 | with | two of them:   |     |              |        |       |      |     |
| --------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- | ------------ | ------ | ----- | ---- | --- |
| int                   | inch | = 100;         |     |              |        |       |      |     |
| double                |      | cm = inch      | *   | CM_PER_INCH; |        |       |      |     |
| System.out.printf("%d |      |                |     | in = %f      | cm\n", | inch, | cm); |     |
| The result            |      | is as follows: |     |              |        |       |      |     |
| 100                   | in   | = 254.000000   |     | cm           |        |       |      |     |
Like print, printf does not append a newline. So format strings often end
| with a | newline | character. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The format specifier %d displays integer values (“d” stands for “decimal”, mean-
ing base 10 integer). The values are matched up with the format specifiers in
order, so inch is displayed using %d, and cm is displayed using %f.

40 Chapter 3 Input and Output
Learning about format strings is like learning a sublanguage within Java.
There are many options, and the details can be overwhelming. Table 3.1
lists a few common uses, to give you an idea of how things work.
%d Integer in base 10 (“decimal”) 12345
%,d Integer with comma separators 12,345
%08d Padded with zeros, at least 8 digits wide 00012345
%f Floating-point number 6.789000
%.2f Rounded to 2 decimal places 6.79
%s String of characters "Hello"
%x Integer in base 16 (“hexadecimal”) bc614e
Table 3.1: Example format specifiers
For more details, refer to the documentation of java.util.Formatter. The
easiest way to find documentation for Java classes is to do a web search for
“Java” and the name of the class.
3.6 Reading Error Messages
Notice that the values you pass to printf are separated by commas. If you are
used to using the + operator to concatenate strings, you might write something
like this by accident:
System.out.printf("inches = %d" + inch); // error
This line of code is legal, so the compiler won’t catch the mistake. Instead,
when you run the program, it causes an exception:
Exception in thread "main" java.util.MissingFormatArgumentException:
Format specifier '%d'
at java.util.Formatter.format(Formatter.java:2519)
at java.io.PrintStream.format(PrintStream.java:970)
at java.io.PrintStream.printf(PrintStream.java:871)
at Example.main(Example.java:10)

| 3.7 Type | Cast Operators |     |     |     |     | 41  |
| -------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
As you saw in Section 2.10, the error message includes the name of the ex-
ception, MissingFormatArgumentException, followed by additional details,
Format specifier ’%d’. That means it doesn’t know what value to substi-
| tute for | %d. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The problem is that concatenation happens first, before printf executes. If
the value of inch is 100, the result of concatenation is "inches = %d100". So
printf gets the format string, but it doesn’t get any values to format.
| The error | message also | includes | a           | that shows | the method | that |
| --------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---- |
|           |              |          | stack trace |            |            |      |
was running when the error was detected, java.util.Formatter.format; the
method that ran it, java.io.PrintStream.format; the method that ran that,
java.io.PrintStream.printf; and finally the method you actually wrote,
Example.main.
Each line also names the source file of the method and the line it was on
(e.g., Example.java:10). That’s a lot of information, and it includes method
names and filenames you have no reason to know at this point. But don’t be
overwhelmed.
When you see an error message like this, read the first line carefully to see
what
happened. Then read the last line to see it happened. In some IDEs,
where
you can click the error message, and it will take you to the line of code that
was running. But remember that where the error is discovered is not always
| where | it was caused. |           |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | -------------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.7   | Type Cast      | Operators |     |     |     |     |
Now suppose we have a measurement in centimeters, and we want to round it
| off to the | nearest inch.       | It is tempting | to write  | this: |     |     |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| inch       | = cm / CM_PER_INCH; |                | // syntax | error |     |     |
But the result is an error—you get something like, “incompatible types: pos-
sible lossy conversion from double to int”. The problem is that the value on
the right is floating-point, and the variable on the left is an integer.
Java converts an int to a double automatically, since no information is lost
in the process. On the other hand, going from double to int would lose the

| 42  |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 3 Input | and Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ------- | ---------- |
decimal places. Java doesn’t perform this operation automatically in order to
ensure that you are aware of the loss of the fractional part of the number.
Thesimplestwaytoconvertafloating-pointvaluetoanintegeristouseatype
cast, so called because it molds, or “casts”, a value from one type to another.
The syntax for type casting is to put the name of the type in parentheses and
| use it as an | operator: |          |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| double       | pi =      | 3.14159; |     |     |     |     |     |
| int x        | = (int)   | pi;      |     |     |     |     |     |
The (int) operator has the effect of converting what follows into an integer.
In this example, x gets the value 3. Like integer division, casting to an in-
teger always rounds toward zero, even if the fractional part is 0.999999 (or
-0.999999). In other words, it simply throws away the fractional part.
In order to use a cast operator, the types must be compatible. For example,
you can’t cast a String to an int because a string is not a number:
| String | str     | = "3"; |           |              |     |       |     |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------ | --- | ----- | --- |
| int x  | = (int) | str;   | // error: | incompatible |     | types |     |
Type casting takes precedence over arithmetic operations. In the following
example, the value of pi gets converted to an integer before the multiplication:
| double | pi = | 3.14159; |            |           |     |       |          |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | --- | ----- | -------- |
| double | x =  | (int)    | pi * 20.0; | // result | is  | 60.0, | not 62.0 |
Keeping that in mind, here’s how we can convert centimeters to inches:
| inch =                | (int) | (cm | / CM_PER_INCH); |           |     |        |     |
| --------------------- | ----- | --- | --------------- | --------- | --- | ------ | --- |
| System.out.printf("%f |       |     | cm =            | %d in\n", | cm, | inch); |     |
The parentheses after the cast operator require the division to happen before
the type cast. And the result is rounded toward zero. You will see in the next
chapter how to round floating-point numbers to the closest integer.
| 3.8 Remainder |     |     | Operator |     |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Let’s take the example one step further: suppose you have a measurement in
inches and you want to convert to feet and inches. The goal is divide by 12
| (the number | of inches | in  | a foot) and | keep the | remainder. |     |     |
| ----------- | --------- | --- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- |

| 3.9 Putting |     | It All | Together |     |     | 43  |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
You have already seen the division operation (/), which computes the quotient
of two numbers. If the numbers are integers, the operation is integer division.
Java also provides the modulo operation (%), which divides two numbers and
| computes | the remainder. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Using division and modulo, we can convert to feet and inches like this:
| feet   | = 76 | / 12; | //  | quotient  |     |     |

| inches | = 76 | % 12; | //  | remainder |     |     |
The first line yields 6. The second line, which is pronounced “76 mod 12”,
| yields 4. | So 76 | inches | is 6 feet, | 4 inches. |     |     |

Many people (and textbooks) incorrectly refer to % as the “modulus operator”.
In mathematics, however, modulus is the number you’re dividing by. In the
| previous | example, | the | modulus | is 12. |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | --- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- |
The Java language specification refers to % as the “remainder operator”. The
remainder operator looks like a percent sign, but you might find it helpful to
| think of | it as a | division | sign | (÷) rotated | to the left. |     |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------ | --- |
Modular arithmetic turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can
check whether one number is divisible by another: if x % y is 0, then x is
divisible by y. You can use the remainder operator to “extract” digits from a
number: x % 10 yields the rightmost digit of x, and x % 100 yields the last
two digits. And many encryption algorithms use remainders extensively.

At this point, you have seen enough Java to write useful programs that solve
everyday problems. You can (1) import Java library classes, (2) create a
Scanner, (3) get input from the keyboard, (4) format output with printf,
and (5) divide and mod integers. Now we will put everything together in a

Now that you’ve had some experience with Scanner, we want to warn you
about an unexpected behavior. The following code fragment asks users for
| their name               | and              | age:    |                |        |            |                    |     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------ | --- |
| System.out.print("What   |                  |         |                | is     | your name? | ");                |     |
| name                     | = in.nextLine(); |         |                |        |            |                    |     |
| System.out.print("What   |                  |         |                | is     | your age?  | ");                |     |
| age                      | = in.nextInt();  |         |                |        |            |                    |     |
| System.out.printf("Hello |                  |         |                |        | %s, age    | %d\n", name, age); |     |
| The output               | might            |         | look something |        | like this: |                    |     |
| Hello                    | Grace            | Hopper, |                | age 45 |            |                    |     |
When you read a String followed by an int, everything works just fine. But
when you read an int followed by a String, something strange happens:
| System.out.print("What   |                  |     |     | is  | your age?  | ");                |     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- |
| age                      | = in.nextInt();  |     |     |     |            |                    |     |
| System.out.print("What   |                  |     |     | is  | your name? | ");                |     |
| name                     | = in.nextLine(); |     |     |     |            |                    |     |
| System.out.printf("Hello |                  |     |     |     | %s, age    | %d\n", name, age); |     |
Try running this example code. It doesn’t let you input your name, and it
| immediately | displays |       | the output: |     |          |     |     |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- | ----------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- |
| What        | is your  | name? | Hello       |     | , age 45 |     |     |
To understand what is happening, you need to realize that Scanner doesn’t
see input as multiple lines as we do. Instead, it gets a stream of characters as
| shown | in Figure | 3.3. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The arrow indicates the next character to be read by Scanner. When you run
nextInt, it reads characters until it gets to a non-digit. Figure 3.4 shows the
| state of | the stream |     | after nextInt |     | runs. |     |     |

| --- | --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------------- | --- | ----- | ------- | --- | ----- | --- |
At this point, nextInt returns the value 45. The program then displays the
prompt "What is your name? " and runs nextLine, which reads characters
until it gets to a newline. But since the next character is already a newline,
| nextLine |     | returns | the empty | string | "". |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ------- | --------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To solve this problem, you need an extra nextLine after nextInt:
|     | System.out.print("What   |                  |     | is       | your    | age?   | "); |       |       |     |     |
| --- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | --- | -------- | ------- | ------ | --- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
|     | age                      | = in.nextInt();  |     |          |         |        |     |       |       |     |     |
|     | in.nextLine();           |                  | //  | read the | newline |        |     |       |       |     |     |
|     | System.out.print("What   |                  |     | is       | your    | name?  | "); |       |       |     |     |
|     | name                     | = in.nextLine(); |     |          |         |        |     |       |       |     |     |
|     | System.out.printf("Hello |                  |     |          | %s, age | %d\n", |     | name, | age); |     |     |
This technique is common when reading int or double values that appear on
their own line. First you read the number, and then you read the rest of the
| line, | which | is just     | a newline | character. |          |         |     |         |        |     |     |

hours, minutes, and seconds. It should (1) prompt the user for input, (2) read
an integer from the keyboard, (3) calculate the result, and (4) use printf to
display the output. For example, "5000 seconds = 1 hours, 23 minutes,

Exercise 3.4 The goal of this exercise is to program a Guess My Number

3.12 Exercises 49
To choose a random number, you can use the Random class in java.util.
Here’s how it works:
import java.util.Random;
public class GuessStarter {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// pick a random number
Random random = new Random();
int number = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
System.out.println(number);
}
}
Like the Scanner class in this chapter, Random has to be imported before we
can use it. And as with Scanner, we have to use the new operator to create a
Random (number generator).
Then we can use the method nextInt to generate a random number. In this
example, the result of nextInt(100) will be between 0 and 99, including both.
Adding 1 yields a number between 1 and 100, including both.
1. The definition of GuessStarter is in a file called GuessStarter.java, in
the directory called ch03, in the repository for this book.
2. Compile and run this program.
3. Modify the program to prompt the user; then use a Scanner to read a
line of user input. Compile and test the program.
4. Read the user input as an integer and display the result. Again, compile
and test.
5. Compute and display the difference between the user’s guess and the
number that was generated.

| Methods |     | and | Testing |     |     |
So far, we’ve written programs that have only one method, named main. In
this chapter, we’ll show you how to organize programs into multiple methods.
We’ll also take a look at the Math class, which provides methods for common
mathematical operations. Finally, we’ll discuss strategies for incrementally
| developing | and testing | your | code.   |     |     |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- |
| 4.1        | Defining    | New  | Methods |     |     |
Some methods perform a computation and return a result. For example,
nextDouble reads input from the keyboard and returns it as a double. Other
methods, like println, carry out a sequence of actions without returning a
| result. Java | uses   | the keyword    | void | to define | such methods: |
| ------------ | ------ | -------------- | ---- | --------- | ------------- |
| public       | static | void newLine() |      | {         |               |
System.out.println();
}
| public | static                    | void main(String[] |     |          | args) { |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------ | --- | -------- | ------- |
|        | System.out.println("First |                    |     | line."); |         |
newLine();
|     | System.out.println("Second |     |     | line."); |     |
| --- | -------------------------- | --- | --- | -------- | --- |
}

| 52  |     |     | Chapter | 4 Methods | and Testing |
| --- | --- | --- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
Inthisexample, thenewLineandmainmethodsarebothpublic, whichmeans
they can be invoked (or “called”) from other classes. And they are both void,
which means that they don’t return a result (in contrast to nextDouble). The
| output | of the program | is shown here: |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| First  | line.          |                |     |     |     |
| Second | line.          |                |     |     |     |
Notice the extra space between the lines. If we wanted more space between
them, we could invoke the same method repeatedly. Or we could write yet
another method (named threeLine) that displays three blank lines:
| public | class NewLine | {              |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | public static | void newLine() | {   |     |     |
System.out.println();
}
|     | public static | void threeLine() | {   |     |     |
| --- | ------------- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- |
newLine();
newLine();
newLine();
}
|     | public static             | void main(String[] |          | args) { |     |
| --- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------- | --- |
|     | System.out.println("First |                    | line."); |         |     |
threeLine();
|     | System.out.println("Second |     | line."); |     |     |
| --- | -------------------------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- |
}
}
In this example, the name of the class is NewLine. By convention, class
names begin with a capital letter. NewLine contains three methods, newLine,
threeLine, and main. Remember that Java is case-sensitive, so NewLine and
| newLine | are not the | same. |     |     |     |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
By convention, method names begin with a lowercase letter and use “camel
case”, which is a cute name for jammingWordsTogetherLikeThis. You can
use any name you want for methods, except main or any of the Java keywords.

| -------- | --- | --------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4.2 Flow |     | of        | Execution |     |     |     |     |
When you look at a class definition that contains several methods, it is tempt-
ing to read it from top to bottom. But that is not the flow of execution, or
the order the program actually runs. The NewLine program runs methods in
| the opposite | order | than | they | are listed. |     |     |     |
| ------------ | ----- | ---- | ---- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
Programs always begin at the first statement of main, regardless of where it is
in the source file. Statements are executed one at a time, in order, until you
reach a method invocation, which you can think of as a detour. Instead of
going to the next statement, you jump to the first line of the invoked method,
execute all the statements there, and then come back and pick up exactly
| where you | left off. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Thatsoundssimpleenough,butrememberthatonemethodcaninvokeanother
one. In the middle of main, the previous example goes off to execute the
statements in threeLine. While in threeLine, it goes off to execute newLine.
Then newLine invokes println, which causes yet another detour.
Fortunately, Java is good at keeping track of which methods are running.
So when println completes, it picks up where it left off in newLine; when
newLine completes, it goes back to threeLine; and when threeLine com-
| pletes, it | gets back | to  | main. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Beginners often wonder why it’s worth the trouble to write other methods,
when they could just do everything in main. The NewLine example demon-
| strates a | few reasons: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• Creating a new method allows you to name a block of statements, which
| makes | the | code | easier | to read and | understand. |     |     |
| ----- | --- | ---- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
• Introducing new methods can make the program shorter by eliminating
repetitive code. For example, to display nine consecutive newlines, you
| could | invoke | threeLine |     | three times. |     |     |     |
| ----- | ------ | --------- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
• Acommonproblem-solvingtechniqueistobreak downintosub-
problems
problems. Methods allow you to focus on each subproblem in isolation,
| and | then | compose | them | into a | complete | solution. |     |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ---- | ------ | -------- | --------- | --- |
Perhaps most importantly, organizing your code into multiple methods allows
you to test individual parts of your program separately. It’s easier to get a
complex program working if you know that each method works correctly.

| 4.3 | Parameters |     |     | and | Arguments |         |     |           |             |
Some of the methods we have used require arguments, which are the values
| you | provide | in parentheses |     | when | you | invoke | the | method. |     |
| --- | ------- | -------------- | --- | ---- | --- | ------ | --- | ------- | --- |
For example, the println method takes a String argument. To display a
message, you have to provide the message: System.out.println("Hello").
Similarly, the printf method can take multiple arguments. The statement
System.out.printf("%d in = %f cm\n", inch, cm) has three arguments:
| the | format | string, | the inch | value, | and | the | cm value. |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --------- | --- | --- |
When you invoke a method, you provide the arguments. When you define a
method, you name the parameters, which are variables that indicate what
| arguments |        | are required. |            | The following |                   | class | shows | an example: |     |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- | --- |
| public    |        | class         | PrintTwice |               | {                 |       |       |             |     |
|           | public | static        |            | void          | printTwice(String |       |       | s) {        |     |
System.out.println(s);
System.out.println(s);
}
|     | public | static            |     | void | main(String[] |     |     | args) {        |     |
| --- | ------ | ----------------- | --- | ---- | ------------- | --- | --- | -------------- | --- |
|     |        | printTwice("Don't |     |      | make          | me  | say | this twice!"); |     |
}
}
The printTwice method has a parameter named s with type String. When
you invoke printTwice, you have to provide an argument with type String.
Before the method executes, the argument gets assigned to the parameter. In
the printTwice example, the argument "Don't make me say this twice!"
| gets | assigned | to the | parameter |     | s.  |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
This process is called parameter passing, because the value gets passed from
outside the method to the inside. An argument can be any kind of expression,
so if you have a String variable, you can use its value as an argument:
| String |     | message | = "Never |     | say | never."; |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ------- | -------- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
printTwice(message);

| 4.4 | Multiple |     | Parameters |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | 55  |
| --- | -------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The value you provide as an argument must have the same (or compatible)
| type | as              | the parameter. |                  | For        | example, |       | if you | try this:   |           |            |     |
| ---- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | --------- | ---------- | --- |
|      | printTwice(17); |                |                  | //         | syntax   | error |        |             |           |            |     |

|      | Error:          | method         |                  | printTwice |          | in    | class  | Test cannot |           | be applied |     |
|      |                 | to             | given            | types;     |          |       |        |             |           |            |     |

This error message says that it found an int argument, but the required
parameter should be a String. In the case of printTwice, Java won’t convert
| the | integer | 17  | to the | string | "17" | automatically. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --- | ------ | ------ | ---- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Sometimes Java can convert an argument from one type to another auto-
matically. For example, Math.sqrt requires a double, but if you invoke
Math.sqrt(25),theintegervalue25isautomaticallyconvertedtothefloating-
| point | value | 25.0. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Parameters and other variables exist only inside their own methods. In the
printTwice example, there is no such thing as s in the main method. If you
| try | to use | it  | there, | you’ll get | a compiler |     | error. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Similarly, inside printTwice there is no such thing as message. That variable
belongs to main. Because variables exist only inside the methods where they
| are | defined, | they | are | often | called |     | variables. |     |     |     |     |

| Here | is     | an example |     | of a method        |     | that | takes two | parameters: |         |     |     |
|      | public | static     |     | void printTime(int |     |      | hour,     | int         | minute) | {   |     |
System.out.print(hour);
System.out.print(":");
System.out.println(minute);
}

| 56  |     |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 4   | Methods | and Testing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- |
To invoke this method, we have to provide two integers as arguments:
| int             | hour   | =   | 11;      |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------------- | ------ | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| int             | minute |     | = 59;    |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| printTime(hour, |        |     | minute); |     |     |     |     |     |     |
Beginners sometimes make the mistake of declaring the arguments:
| int           | hour   | =   | 11;   |              |     |     |        |       |     |
| ------------- | ------ | --- | ----- | ------------ | --- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- |
| int           | minute |     | = 59; |              |     |     |        |       |     |
| printTime(int |        |     | hour, | int minute); |     | //  | syntax | error |     |
That’s a syntax error, because the compiler sees int hour and int minute
as variable declarations, not expressions that represent values. You wouldn’t
| declare       | the | types | of the arguments |      | if they | were   | simply | integers: |     |
| ------------- | --- | ----- | ---------------- | ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | --- |
| printTime(int |     |       | 11, int          | 59); | //      | syntax | error  |           |     |
Pulling together the code fragments, here is the complete program:
| public |        | class | PrintTime   | {             |     |     |       |             |     |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------- | ------------- | --- | --- | ----- | ----------- | --- |
|        | public |       | static void | printTime(int |     |     | hour, | int minute) | {   |
System.out.print(hour);
System.out.print(":");
System.out.println(minute);
}
|     | public |                 | static void | main(String[] |     |     | args) | {   |     |
| --- | ------ | --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
|     |        | int             | hour = 11;  |               |     |     |       |     |     |
|     |        | int             | minute =    | 59;           |     |     |       |     |     |
|     |        | printTime(hour, |             | minute);      |     |     |       |     |     |
}
}
printTime has two parameters, named hour and minute. And main has two
variables, also named hour and minute. Although they have the same names,
these variables are not the same. The hour in printTime and the hour in
main refer to different memory locations, and they can have different values.

| int            | hour =   | 11;   |     |     |     |     |     |
| int            | minute   | = 59; |     |     |     |     |     |
| printTime(hour |          | + 1,  | 0); |     |     |     |     |
Before the method is invoked, Java evaluates the arguments; in this example,
the results are 12 and 0. Then it assigns those values to the parameters. Inside
printTime, the value of hour is 12, not 11, and the value of minute is 0, not
59. Furthermore, if printTime modifies one of its parameters, that change
| has no | effect on | the variables | in main. |     |     |     |     |

One way to keep track of variables is to draw a stack diagram, which is
a memory diagram (see Section 2.3) that shows currently running methods.
For each method there is a box, called a frame, that contains the method’s
parameters and local variables. The name of the method appears outside the
| frame; | the variables | and parameters |     | appear | inside. |     |     |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------- | --- | ------ | ------- | --- | --- |
As with memory diagrams, stack diagrams show variables and methods at a
particular point in time. Figure 4.1 is a stack diagram at the beginning of the
printTime method. Notice that main is on top, because it executed first.
|     |        | main       | hour    | 11  | minute         | 59       |     |

|     | Figure | 4.1: Stack | diagram | for | printTime(hour | + 1, 0). |     |
Stack diagrams help you to visualize the scope of a variable, which is the area
| of a program | where | a variable | can | be used. |     |     |     |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
Stack diagrams are a good mental model for how variables and methods work
at run-time. Learning to trace the execution of a program on paper (or on a
whiteboard) is a useful skill for communicating with other programmers.
Educational tools can automatically draw stack diagrams for you. For ex-
ample, Java Tutor (https://thinkjava.org/javatutor) allows you to step

through an entire program, both forward and backward, and see the stack
frames and variables at each step. If you haven’t already, you should check

| 4.6     | Math          | Methods |               |     |     |     |
You don’t always have to write new methods to get work done. As a reminder,
the Java library contains thousands of classes you can use. For example, the
| Math class | provides | common             | mathematical | operations: |     |     |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ----------- | --- | --- |
| double     | root     | = Math.sqrt(17.0); |              |             |     |     |
| double     | angle    | = 1.5;             |              |             |     |     |
| double     | height   | = Math.sin(angle); |              |             |     |     |
The first line sets root to the square root of 17. The third line finds the sine
of 1.5 (the value of angle). Math is in the java.lang package, so you don’t
| have to | import | it. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Values for the trigonometric functions—sin, cos, and tan—must be in radi-
ans. To convert from degrees to radians, you divide by 180 and multiply by
π. Conveniently, the Math class provides a constant named PI that contains
| an approximation |         | of π:     |         |            |     |     |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| double           | degrees | = 90;     |         |            |     |     |
| double           | angle   | = degrees | / 180.0 | * Math.PI; |     |     |
NoticethatPIisincapitalletters. JavadoesnotrecognizePi,pi,orpie. Also,
PI is the name of a constant, not a method, so it doesn’t have parentheses.
ThesameistruefortheconstantMath.E, whichapproximatesEuler’snumber.
Converting to and from radians is a common operation, so the Math class
| provides | methods | that do                    | that for you: |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| double   | radians | = Math.toRadians(180.0);   |               |     |     |     |
| double   | degrees | = Math.toDegrees(Math.PI); |               |     |     |     |
Another useful method is round, which rounds a floating-point value to the
nearest integer and returns a long. The following result is 63 (rounded up
from 62.8319):

4.7 Composition 59
| long | x = Math.round(Math.PI |     | * 20.0); |     |     |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- |
A long is like an int, but bigger. More specifically, an int uses 32 bits of
memory; the largest value it can hold is 231 −1, which is about 2 billion. A
long uses 64 bits, so the largest value is 263 −1, which is about 9 quintillion.
Take a minute to read the documentation for these and other methods in the
Math class. The easiest way to find documentation for Java classes is to do a
| web search | for “Java”  | and the | name of the | class. |     |

You have probably learned how to evaluate simple expressions like
sin(π/2)
and log(1/x). First, you evaluate the expression in parentheses, which is the
argument of the function. Then you can evaluate the function itself, either by
| hand or | by punching | it into a | calculator. |     |     |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
This process can be applied repeatedly to evaluate more-complex expressions
like log(1/sin(π/2)). First we evaluate the argument of the innermost function
(π/2 1.57), then evaluate the function itself (sin(1.57) 1.0), and so on.
| =   |     |     |     |     | =   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Just as with mathematical functions, Java methods can be to solve
composed
complex problems. That means you can use one method as part of another.
In fact, you can use any expression as an argument to a method, as long as
| the resulting | value              | has the correct | type:     |         |     |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------- | ------- | --- |
| double        | x = Math.cos(angle |                 | + Math.PI | / 2.0); |     |
This statement divides Math.PI by 2.0, adds the result to angle, and com-
putes the cosine of the sum. You can also take the result of one method and
| pass it | as an argument                | to another: |     |     |     |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
| double  | x = Math.exp(Math.log(10.0)); |             |     |     |     |
In Java, the log method always uses base e. So this statement finds the log
base e of 10, and then raises e to that power. The result gets assigned to x.
Some math methods take more than one argument. For example, Math.pow
takes two arguments and raises the first to the power of the second. This line
| computes | 210 and | assigns the value | 1024.0 | to the variable | x:  |

| double | x   | = Math.pow(2.0, |     | 10.0); |         |           |     |             |
WhenusingMathmethods,beginnersoftenforgetthewordMath. Forexample,
if you just write x = pow(2.0, 10.0), you will get a compiler error:
| File:     | Test.java | [line: |                    | 5]  |     |     |     |     |

| location: |           | class  | Test               |     |     |     |     |     |
The message “cannot find symbol” is confusing, but the last two lines provide
a useful hint. The compiler is looking for a method named pow in the file
Test.java (the file for this example). If you don’t specify a class name when
referring to a method, the compiler looks in the current class by default.

| --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
When you invoke a void method, the invocation is usually on a line all by
| itself.        | For example: |      |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| printTime(hour |              | + 1, | 0); |     |     |     |     |     |
On the other hand, when you invoke a value-returning method, you have to
do something with the return value. We usually assign it to a variable or use
| it as part | of     | an expression,    | like | this:              |            |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | ---- | ------------------ | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| double     | error  | = Math.abs(expect |      |                    | - actual); |     |     |     |
| double     | height | = radius          |      | * Math.sin(angle); |            |     |     |     |
Compared to void methods, value-returning methods differ in two ways:
| • They | declare | the type | of  | the | return value | (the |     | type). |
| ------ | ------- | -------- | --- | --- | ------------ | ---- | --- | ------ |
return
| • They | use | at least | one return |     | statement | to provide | a   | value. |

Here’s an example from a program named Circle.java. The calculateArea
method takes a double as a parameter and returns the area of a circle with
| that radius |     | (i.e., πr2): |     |     |     |     |     |     |

}
As usual, this method is public and static. But in the place where we are
used to seeing void, we see double, which means that the return value from
| this | method | is a | double. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The last line is a new form of the return statement that means, “Return
immediately from this method, and use the following expression as the return
value.” The expression you provide can be arbitrarily complex, so we could
| have   | written | this   | method  | more | concisely:           |           |     |         |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ---- | -------------------- | --------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
| public |         | static | double  |      | calculateArea(double |           |     | radius) | {   |     |
|        | return  |        | Math.PI | *    | radius               | * radius; |     |         |     |     |

easier, especially when you are stepping through code by using an interactive

Figure 4.2 illustrates how data values flows through the program. When the
main method invokes calculateArea, the value 5.0 is assigned to the param-
eter radius. calculateArea then returns the value 78.54, which is assigned
| to the | variable | area. |         |     |             |     |            |            |        |     |

The type of the expression in the return statement must match the return
type of the method itself. When you declare that the return type is double,
you are making a promise that this method will eventually produce a double
value. If you try to return with no expression, or return an expression with
| the | wrong | type,       | the compiler | will        | give | an error. |     |     |     |

People often make the mistake of writing a lot of code before they try to
compile and run it. Then they spend way too much time debugging. A better
| approach |     | is  |     | development. |     | Its | key aspects | are | as follows: |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- | ----------- | --- | ----------- |
incremental
• Start with a working program and make small, incremental changes. At
|     | any | point, | if there | is an error, |     | you will know | where | to  | look. |
| --- | --- | ------ | -------- | ------------ | --- | ------------- | ----- | --- | ----- |
• Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can check them, either
|     | with | print | statements | or  | by using | a debugger. |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
• Once the program is working, you can consolidate multiple statements
into compound expressions (but only if it does not make the program
|     | more | difficult | to  | read). |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | --------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points,
given by the coordinates (x ,y ) and (x ,y ). By the usual definition:
|     |     |     |     | 1 1 |     | 2 2 |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
(cid:112)
|     |     |     | distance | =   | (x  | −x )2 +(y | −y  | )2  |     |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |          |     |     | 2 1       | 2   | 1   |     |
The first step is to consider what a distance method should look like in Java.
In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output
(return value)? For this method, the parameters are the two points, and it is
natural to represent them using four double values. The return value is the
| distance, |     | which | should | also have | type | double. |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | ----- | ------ | --------- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
Already we can write an outline for the method, which is sometimes called a
stub. The stub includes the method declaration and a return statement:

| 4.9 Incremental |             | Development     |            |                |     | 63  |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------- | --- | --- |
| public          | static      | double distance |            |                |     |     |
|                 | (double     | x1, double      | y1, double | x2, double y2) | {   |     |
|                 | return 0.0; | // stub         |            |                |     |     |
}
The return statement is a placeholder that is necessary only for the program
to compile. At this stage, the program doesn’t do anything useful, but it is
good to compile it so we can find any syntax errors before we add more code.
It’susuallyagoodideatothinkabouttestingbeforeyoudevelopnewmethods;
doing so can help you figure out how to implement them. To test the method,
| we can | invoke it | from main by using | the sample | values: |     |     |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| double | dist      | = distance(1.0,    | 2.0, 4.0,  | 6.0);   |     |     |
With these values, the horizontal distance is 3.0 and the vertical distance is
4.0. So the result should be 5.0, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle. When you
| are testing | a method, | it is necessary | to know | the right answer. |     |     |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------------- | --- | --- |
Once we have compiled the stub, we can start adding code one line at a time.
After each incremental change, we recompile and run the program. If there is
an error, we have a good idea of where to look: the lines we just added.
The next step is to find the differences, and . We store those
|     |     |     | x −x | y −y  |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | ----- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     | 2    | 1 2 1 |     |     |
values in temporary variables named dx and dy, so that we can examine them
with print statements before proceeding. They should be 3.0 and 4.0:
| public | static                 | double distance |             |                |     |     |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --- | --- |
|        | (double                | x1, double      | y1, double  | x2, double y2) | {   |     |
|        | double dx              | = x2 - x1;      |             |                |     |     |
|        | double dy              | = y2 - y1;      |             |                |     |     |
|        | System.out.println("dx |                 | is " + dx); |                |     |     |
|        | System.out.println("dy |                 | is " + dy); |                |     |     |
|        | return 0.0;            | // stub         |             |                |     |     |
}
We will remove the print statements when the method is finished. Code like
that is called scaffolding, because it is helpful for building the program but
| is not part | of the | final product. |     |     |     |     |

The next step is to square dx and dy. We could use the Math.pow method,
but it is simpler (and more efficient) to multiply each term by itself. Then we
| add    | the squares                  | and      | print the result | so far:    |                |       |

Again, you should compile and run the program at this stage and check the
intermediate value, which should be 25.0. Finally, we can use Math.sqrt to
| compute | and     | return the | result:                |            |            |       |

As you gain more experience programming, you might write and debug more
than one line at a time. But if you find yourself spending a lot of time debug-

2. Test your method by invoking it from main and passing appropriate
arguments. The output should look something like this (except the date
|     | might   | be different): |          |      |     |     |     |     |     |     |

In the last part of this exercise, you need to write a method that invokes
another method you wrote. Whenever you do that, it is a good idea to test
the first method carefully before working on the second. Otherwise, you might
find yourself debugging two methods at the same time, which can be difficult.
One of the purposes of this exercise is to practice pattern-matching: the ability

The programs in the previous chapters do the same thing every time they
are run, regardless of the input. For more-complex computations, programs
usually react to inputs, check for certain conditions, and generate applicable
results. This chapter introduces Java language features for expressing logic
| and making     | decisions. |     |           |     |     |     |

| 5.1 Relational |            |     | Operators |     |     |     |
Java has six relational operators that test the relationship between two
values (e.g., whether they are equal, or whether one is greater than the other).
| The following | expressions |     | show how     | they are | used:    |            |
| ------------- | ----------- | --- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| x == y        |             | //  | x is equal   | to y     |          |            |
| x != y        |             | //  | x is not     | equal    | to y     |            |
| x > y         |             | //  | x is greater | than     | y        |            |
| x < y         |             | //  | x is less    | than     | y        |            |
| x >= y        |             | //  | x is greater | than     | or       | equal to y |
| x <= y        |             | //  | x is less    | than     | or equal | to y       |
The result of a relational operator is one of two special values: true or false.
These values belong to the data type boolean, named after the mathematician
George Boole. He developed an algebraic way of representing logic.

Youareprobablyfamiliarwiththeseoperators, butnoticehowJavaisdifferent
from mathematical symbols like =, ̸=, and ≥. A common error is to use a
single = instead of a double == when comparing values. Remember that = is
| the        | operator,     | and | == is a    | operator. | Also, | the operators |
| ---------- | ------------- | --- | ---------- | --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| assignment |               |     | relational |           |       |               |
| =< and =>  | do not exist. |     |            |           |       |               |
The two sides of a relational operator have to be compatible. For example, the
expression 5 < "6" is invalid because 5 is an int and "6" is a String. When
comparing values of different numeric types, Java applies the same conversion
rules you saw previously with the assignment operator. For example, when
evaluating the expression 5 < 6.0, Java automatically converts the 5 to 5.0.
| 5.2 | The if-else | Statement |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To write useful programs, we almost always need to check conditions and
| react accordingly.    |             |         |                      | give us this | ability. | The simplest |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
|                       | Conditional |         | statements           |              |          |              |
| conditional           | statement   | in Java | is the if statement: |              |          |              |
| if (x                 | > 0) {      |         |                      |              |          |              |
| System.out.println("x |             |         | is positive");       |              |          |              |
}
The expression in parentheses is called the condition. If it is true, the state-
mentsinbracesgetexecuted. Iftheconditionisfalse, executionskipsoverthat
block of code. The condition in parentheses can be any boolean expression.
A second form of conditional statement has two possibilities, indicated by if
and else. The possibilities are called branches, and the condition determines
| which branch          | gets   | executed: |            |     |     |     |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| if (x                 | % 2 == | 0) {      |            |     |     |     |
| System.out.println("x |        |           | is even"); |     |     |     |
| } else                | {      |           |            |     |     |     |
| System.out.println("x |        |           | is odd");  |     |     |     |
}
If the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 0, we know that x is even, and the
program displays a message to that effect. If the condition is false, the second

| 5.2 The | if-else | Statement |     |     | 73  |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
print statement is executed instead. Since the condition must be true or false,
| exactly | one of the | branches | will run. |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- | --- | --- |
The braces are optional for branches that have only one statement. So we
| could have | written               | the | previous example | this way: |     |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --- | ---------------- | --------- | --- |
| if (x      | % 2 ==                | 0)  |                  |           |     |
|            | System.out.println("x |     | is               | even");   |     |
else
|     | System.out.println("x |     | is  | odd"); |     |
| --- | --------------------- | --- | --- | ------ | --- |
However, it’s better to use braces—even when they are optional—to avoid
making the mistake of adding statements to a one-line if or else block. This
| code is | misleading            | because | it’s not indented | correctly:  |     |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --- |
| if (x   | > 0)                  |         |                   |             |     |
|         | System.out.println("x |         | is                | positive"); |     |
|         | System.out.println("x |         | is                | not zero"); |     |
Since there are no braces, only the first println is part of the if statement.
| Here is | what the              | compiler | actually sees: |             |     |
| ------- | --------------------- | -------- | -------------- | ----------- | --- |
| if (x   | > 0)                  | {        |                |             |     |
|         | System.out.println("x |          | is             | positive"); |     |
}
|     | System.out.println("x |     | is  | not zero"); |     |
| --- | --------------------- | --- | --- | ----------- | --- |
As a result, the second println runs no matter what. Even experienced
programmers make this mistake; search the web for Apple’s “goto fail” bug.
In all previous examples, notice that there is no semicolon at the end of the if
or else lines. Instead, a new block should be defined using braces. Another
common mistake is to put a semicolon after the condition, like this:
| int   | x = 1;                |     |                |           |     |
| ----- | --------------------- | --- | -------------- | --------- | --- |
| if (x | % 2 ==                | 0); | { // incorrect | semicolon |     |
|       | System.out.println("x |     | is             | even");   |     |
}
This code will compile, but the program will output "x is even" regardless
of the value of x. Here is the same incorrect code with better formatting:

| 74    |            |           | Chapter | 5 Conditionals | and Logic |
| ----- | ---------- | --------- | ------- | -------------- | --------- |
| int   | x = 1;     |           |         |                |           |
| if (x | % 2 ==     | 0)        |         |                |           |
|       | ; // empty | statement |         |                |           |
{
|     | System.out.println("x |     | is even"); |     |     |
| --- | --------------------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- |
}
Because of the semicolon, the if statement compiles as if there are no braces,
and the subsequent block runs independently. As a general rule, each line of
| Java code | should end | with a semicolon | or brace—but | not both. |     |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | --- |
The compiler won’t complain if you omit optional braces or write empty state-
ments. Doing so is allowed by the Java language, but it often results in bugs
that are difficult to find. Development tools like Checkstyle (see Appendix ??)
can warn you about these and other kinds of programming mistakes.
| 5.3 | Chaining | and Nesting |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
Sometimes you want to check related conditions and choose one of several
actions. One way to do this is by chaining a series of if and else blocks:
| if (x  | > 0) {                |        |                |     |     |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------ | -------------- | --- | --- |
|        | System.out.println("x |        | is positive"); |     |     |
| } else | if (x                 | < 0) { |                |     |     |
|        | System.out.println("x |        | is negative"); |     |     |
| } else | {                     |        |                |     |     |
|        | System.out.println("x |        | is zero");     |     |     |
}
These chains can be as long as you want, although they can be difficult to
read if they get out of hand. One way to make them easier to read is to use
standard indentation, as demonstrated in these examples. If you keep all the
statements and braces lined up, you are less likely to make syntax errors.
Notice that the last branch is simply else, not else if (x == 0). At this
point in the chain, we know that x is not positive and x is not negative. There
is no need to test whether x is 0, because there is no other possibility.

| 5.4 The | switch | Statement |     |     |     | 75  |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In addition to chaining, you can also make complex decisions by nesting one
conditional statement inside another. We could have written the previous
| example | as follows:           |      |                |             |     |     |
| ------- | --------------------- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| if (x   | > 0)                  | {    |                |             |     |     |
|         | System.out.println("x |      | is positive"); |             |     |     |
| } else  | {                     |      |                |             |     |     |
|         | if (x <               | 0) { |                |             |     |     |
|         | System.out.println("x |      | is             | negative"); |     |     |
|         | } else                | {    |                |             |     |     |
|         | System.out.println("x |      | is             | zero");     |     |     |
}
}
The outer conditional has two branches. The first branch contains a print
statement, and the second branch contains another conditional statement,
which has two branches of its own. These two branches are also print state-
| ments, but | they | could have been | conditional | statements | as well. |     |
| ---------- | ---- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | --- |
These kinds of nested structures are common, but they can become difficult
to read very quickly. Good indentation is essential to make the structure (or
| intended | structure) | apparent  | to the reader. |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.4      | The switch | Statement |                |     |     |     |
If you need to make a series of decisions, chaining else if blocks can get long
and redundant. For example, consider a program that converts integers like
| 1, 2, and  | 3 into     | words like "one", | "two", | and "three": |     |     |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------------ | --- | --- |
| if (number |            | == 1) {           |        |              |     |     |
|            | word =     | "one";            |        |              |     |     |
| } else     | if (number | == 2)             | {      |              |     |     |
|            | word =     | "two";            |        |              |     |     |
| } else     | if (number | == 3)             | {      |              |     |     |
|            | word =     | "three";          |        |              |     |     |
| } else     | {          |                   |        |              |     |     |
|            | word =     | "unknown";        |        |              |     |     |
}

| 76  |     | Chapter | 5 Conditionals | and Logic |
| --- | --- | ------- | -------------- | --------- |
This chain could go on and on, especially for banking programs that write
numbers in long form (e.g., “one hundred twenty-three and 45/100 dollars”).
An alternative way to evaluate many possible values of an expression is to use
| a switch statement: |     |     |     |     |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| switch (number)     | {   |     |     |     |
| case                | 1:  |     |     |     |
word = "one";
break;
| case | 2:  |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
word = "two";
break;
| case | 3:  |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
word = "three";
break;
default:
word = "unknown";
break;
}
The body of a switch statement is organized into one or more case blocks.
Each case ends with a break statement, which exits the switch body. The
default block is optional and executed only if none of the cases apply.
Although switch statements appear longer than chained else if blocks, they
| are particularly | useful when | multiple cases | can be grouped: |     |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------------- | --- |
| switch (food)    | {           |                |                 |     |
| case             | "apple":    |                |                 |     |
| case             | "banana":   |                |                 |     |
| case             | "cherry":   |                |                 |     |
System.out.println("Fruit!");
break;
| case | "asparagus": |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
| case | "broccoli":  |     |     |     |
| case | "carrot":    |     |     |     |
System.out.println("Vegetable!");
break;
}

| 5.5 | Logical |           | Operators |     |     |     |     |     |     |
In addition to the relational operators, Java also has three operators:
logical
&&, ||, and !, which respectively stand for and, or, and not. The results of
these operators are similar to their meanings in English. For example:
• x > 0 && x < 10 is true when x is greater than 0 and less than 10.
• x < 0 || x > 10 is true if either condition is true; that is, if x is less
|     | than | 0 or greater | than | 10. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• !(x > 0)istrueifxisnotgreaterthan0. Theparenthesesarenecessary
in this example because, in the order of operations, ! comes before >.
In order for an expression with && to be true, both sides of the && operator
must be true. And in order for an expression with || to be false, both sides
| of  | the || | operator must | be  | false. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The && operator can be used to simplify nested if statements. For example,
| the | following | code can                 | be  | rewritten | with | a single | condition: |         |     |
| --- | --------- | ------------------------ | --- | --------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------- | --- |
|     | if (x     | == 0) {                  |     |           |      |          |            |         |     |
|     | if        | (y == 0)                 | {   |           |      |          |            |         |     |
|     |           | System.out.println("Both |     |           |      | x and    | y are      | zero"); |     |
}
}
// combined
|     | if (x                    | == 0 && | y == | 0) { |     |         |             |     |     |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------- | ---- | ---- | --- | ------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
|     | System.out.println("Both |         |      |      |     | x and y | are zero"); |     |     |
}
Likewise, the || operator can simplify chained if statements. Since the
| branches |                            | are the same, | there | is  | no need | to duplicate | that         | code: |     |

|          | if (x                      | == 0) {       |       |     |         |              |              |       |     |

|          | } else                     | if (y ==      | 0)    | {   |         |              |              |       |     |
|          | System.out.println("Either |               |       |     |         | x or         | y is zero"); |       |     |
}

| if  | (x                         | == 0 || | y == | 0) { |     |      |      |         |     |

|     | System.out.println("Either |         |      |      |     | x or | y is | zero"); |     |
}
Then again, if the statements in the branches were different, we could not
combine them into one block. But it’s useful to explore different ways of
| representing |     | the same | logic, | especially | when |     | it’s complex. |     |     |
| ------------ | --- | -------- | ------ | ---------- | ---- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- |
Logical operators evaluate the second expression necessary. For
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | only when |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------- | --- |
example, true || anything is always true, so Java does not need to evaluate
the expression anything. Likewise, false && anything is always false.
Ignoring the second operand, when possible, is called evalua-
short-circuit
tion, by analogy with an electrical circuit. Short-circuit evaluation can save
time, especially if anything takes a long time to evaluate. It can also avoid
| unnecessary |     | errors,  | if anything | might | fail. |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | -------- | ----------- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.6         | De  | Morgan’s |             | Laws  |       |     |     |     |     |
Sometimes you need to negate an expression containing a mix of relational
and logical operators. For example, to test if x and y are both nonzero, you
| could | write                       | the following: |      |     |     |       |     |            |     |
| ----- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ---- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | ---------- | --- |
| if    | (!(x                        | == 0 ||        | y == | 0)) | {   |       |     |            |     |
|       | System.out.println("Neither |                |      |     |     | x nor | y   | is zero"); |     |
}
This condition is difficult to read because of the ! and parentheses. A better
| way | to negate | logic    | expressions | is  | to apply | De  | Morgan’s | laws: |     |
| --- | --------- | -------- | ----------- | --- | -------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- |
| •   | !(A       | && B) is | the same    | as  | !A ||    | !B  |          |       |     |
| •   | !(A       | || B) is | the same    | as  | !A &&    | !B  |          |       |     |
In words, negating a logical expression is the same as negating each term and
changing the operator. The ! operator takes precedence over && and ||, so
you don’t have to put parentheses around the individual terms !A and !B.
De Morgan’s laws also apply to the relational operators. In this case, negating
| each | term | means using | the | “opposite” | relational |     | operator: |     |     |

| 5.7 | Boolean | Variables |      |       |          |     |      |      |        |     | 79  |
| --- | ------- | --------- | ---- | ----- | -------- | --- | ---- | ---- | ------ | --- | --- |
| •   | !(x     | < 5 && y  | ==   | 3) is | the same | as  | x >= | 5 || | y != 3 |     |     |
| •   | !(x     | >= 1 ||   | y != | 7) is | the same | as  | x <  | 1 && | y == 7 |     |     |
It may help to read these examples out loud in English. For instance, “If I
don’t want the case where is less than 5 and is 3, then I need to be
|         |      |          |     | x       |      |       |          | y   |     | x   |     |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------- | ---- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| greater | than | or equal | to  | 5, or I | need | to be | anything | but | 3.” |     |     |
y
Returning to the previous example, here is the revised condition. In English,
it reads, “If x is not zero and y is not zero.” The logic is the same, and the
| source | code                        | is easier | to read: |      |     |     |       |            |     |     |     |
| ------ | --------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---- | --- | --- | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| if     | (x                          | != 0 &&   | y !=     | 0) { |     |     |       |            |     |     |     |
|        | System.out.println("Neither |           |          |      |     | x   | nor y | is zero"); |     |     |     |
}
| 5.7 | Boolean |     | Variables |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To store a true or false value, you need a boolean variable. You can declare
and assign them like other variables. In this example, the first line is a variable
| declaration, |     | the second | is  | an assignment, |     | and | the | third | is both: |     |     |
| ------------ | --- | ---------- | --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| boolean      |     | flag;      |     |                |     |     |     |       |          |     |     |
| flag         | =   | true;      |     |                |     |     |     |       |          |     |     |
| boolean      |     | testResult |     | = false;       |     |     |     |       |          |     |     |
Since relational and logical operators evaluate to a boolean value, you can
| store   | the | result of a  | comparison |      | in a     | variable: |     |      |                  |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ------------ | ---------- | ---- | -------- | --------- | --- | ---- | ---------------- | --- | --- |
| boolean |     | evenFlag     | =          | (x % | 2 ==     | 0);       | //  | true | if x is even     |     |     |
| boolean |     | positiveFlag |            | =    | (x > 0); |           | //  | true | if x is positive |     |     |
Theparenthesesareunnecessary, buttheymakethecodeeasiertounderstand.
A variable defined in this way is called a flag, because it signals, or “flags”, the
| presence |                       | or absence     | of a | condition. |     |               |      |            |       |     |     |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | ------------- | ---- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| You      | can use               | flag variables |      | as part    | of  | a conditional |      | statement: |       |     |     |
| if       | (evenFlag)            |                | {    |            |     |               |      |            |       |     |     |
|          | System.out.println("n |                |      |            | was | even          | when | I checked  | it"); |     |     |
}

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | -------------- | --------- |
Flags may not seem that useful at this point, but they will help simplify
complex conditions later. Each part of a condition can be stored in a separate
| flag, | and these | flags | can | be combined | with | logical | operators. |     |
| ----- | --------- | ----- | --- | ----------- | ---- | ------- | ---------- | --- |
Noticethatwedidn’thavetowrite if (evenFlag == true). SinceevenFlag
is a boolean, it’s already a condition. To check if a flag is false, we simply
| negate | the flag:             |     |     |     |         |      |           |       |
| ------ | --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| if     | (!evenFlag)           |     | {   |     |         |      |           |       |
|        | System.out.println("n |     |     |     | was odd | when | I checked | it"); |
}
In general, you should never compare anything to true or false. Doing so
| makes | the code | more | verbose |     | and awkward | to  | read out loud. |     |

| 5.8   | Boolean  |      | Methods |     |             |     |                |     |
Methods can return boolean values, just like any other type, which is often
| convenient | for    | hiding | tests   | inside            | methods. | For | example: |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------------- | -------- | --- | -------- | --- |
| public     | static |        | boolean | isSingleDigit(int |          |     | x) {     |     |
|            | if (x  | > -10  | &&      | x <               | 10) {    |     |          |     |
|            |        | return | true;   |                   |          |     |          |     |
|            | } else | {      |         |                   |          |     |          |     |
|            |        | return | false;  |                   |          |     |          |     |
}
}
The name of this method is isSingleDigit. It is common to give boolean
methods names that sound like yes/no questions. Since the return type is
boolean, the return statement has to provide a boolean expression.
The code itself is straightforward, although it is longer than it needs to be.
Rememberthattheexpressionx > -10 && x < 10hastypeboolean,sothere
is nothing wrong with returning it directly (without the if statement):
| public | static |     | boolean | isSingleDigit(int |       |     | x) { |     |
| ------ | ------ | --- | ------- | ----------------- | ----- | --- | ---- | --- |
|        | return | x   | > -10   | && x              | < 10; |     |      |     |
}

| 5.9 Validating |         | Input  |     |           |           |       | 81  |
| -------------- | ------- | ------ | --- | --------- | --------- | ----- | --- |
| In main,       | you can | invoke | the | method in | the usual | ways: |     |
System.out.println(isSingleDigit(2));
| boolean | bigFlag |     | = !isSingleDigit(17); |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- | --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The first line displays true because 2 is a single-digit number. The second
line sets bigFlag to true, because 17 is not a single-digit number.
Conditional statements often invoke boolean methods and use the result as
the condition:
| if     | (isSingleDigit(z))    |     |     | {           |     |     |     |
| ------ | --------------------- | --- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | System.out.println("z |     |     | is small"); |     |     |     |
| } else | {                     |     |     |             |     |     |     |
|        | System.out.println("z |     |     | is big");   |     |     |     |
}
Examples like this one almost read like English: “If is single digit z, print z is
| small else | print      | z is big.” |       |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.9        | Validating |            | Input |     |     |     |     |
One of the most important tasks in any computer program is to
validate
input from the user. People often make mistakes while typing, especially on
smartphones, and incorrect inputs may cause your program to fail.
Even worse, someone (i.e., a hacker) may intentionally try to break into your
system by entering unexpected inputs. You should never assume that users
| will input | the right | kind | of data. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --------- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Consider this simple program that prompts the user for a number and com-
| putes its               | logarithm: |                  |                     |           |         |     |     |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| Scanner                 | in         | = new            | Scanner(System.in); |           |         |     |     |
| System.out.print("Enter |            |                  |                     | a number: | ");     |     |     |
| double                  | x =        | in.nextDouble(); |                     |           |         |     |     |
| double                  | y =        | Math.log(x);     |                     |           |         |     |     |
| System.out.println("The |            |                  |                     | log is    | " + y); |     |     |

| 82  |     |     |     | Chapter | 5 Conditionals | and Logic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | -------------- | --------- |
In mathematics, the natural logarithm (base e) is undefined when x ≤ 0. In
Java, if you ask for Math.log(-1), it returns NaN, which stands for “not a
number”. We can check for this condition and print an appropriate message:
| if  | (x                      | > 0) {           |     |        |              |     |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --- | ------ | ------------ | --- |
|     | double                  | y = Math.log(x); |     |        |              |     |
|     | System.out.println("The |                  |     | log is | " + y);      |     |
| }   | else                    | {                |     |        |              |     |
|     | System.out.println("The |                  |     | log is | undefined"); |     |
}
The output is better now, but there is another problem. What if the user
doesn’t enter a number at all? What would happen if they typed the word
| “hello”,  | either | by accident                                     | or on purpose?                          |     |     |     |

If the user inputs a String when we expect a double, Java reports an “input
mismatch” exception. We can prevent this run-time error from happening by
| testing | the | input first. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The Scanner class provides hasNextDouble, which checks whether the next
input can be interpreted as a double. If not, we can display an error message:
| if  | (!in.hasNextDouble())   |      |              | {     |                 |     |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---- | ------------ | ----- | --------------- | --- |
|     | String                  | word | = in.next(); |       |                 |     |
|     | System.err.println(word |      |              | + "is | not a number"); |     |
}
In contrast to in.nextLine, which returns an entire line of input, the in.next
method returns only the next token of input. We can use in.next to show
| the | user exactly | which | word they | typed was | not a number. |     |
| --- | ------------ | ----- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | --- |
This example also uses System.err, which is an OutputStream for error
messages and warnings. Some development environments display output to
| System.err |     | with a different | color | or in a separate | window. |     |

What started as five lines of code at the beginning of Section 5.9 is now a
30-line program. Making programs robust (and secure) often requires a lot of
| additional |     | checking, |     | as shown | in this | example. |     |     |     |     |

It’s important to write comments every few lines to make your code easier to
understand. Comments not only help other people read your code, but also
help you document what you’re trying to do. If there’s a mistake in the code,
| finding |     | it will be | a lot | easier | when     | there are | good comments. |     |        |     |

The code for this chapter is in the ch05 directory of ThinkJavaCode2. See
page x for instructions on how to download the repository. Before you start
the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.
If you have not already read Appendix ??, now might be a good time. It
describes Checkstyle, a tool that analyzes many aspects of your source code.
Exercise 5.1 Rewrite the following code by using a single if statement:
|     | if (x | > 0) {                       |     |     |        |     |                  |     |

|     | if    | (x < 10)                     | {   |     |        |     |                  |     |
|     |       | System.out.println("positive |     |     | single |     | digit number."); |     |

You should already have a program that chooses a random number, prompts
the user to guess it, and displays the difference between the guess and the
chosen number.
By adding a small amount of code at a time and testing as you go, modify the
program so it tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low, and then
| prompts |     | the user | for another | guess. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The program should continue until the user gets it right or guesses incorrectly
three times. If the user guesses the correct number, display a message and
| terminate |     | the program. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Write a program named that inputs four integers (a, b, c, and

arrange them in a triangle. For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long
and the other two are 1 inch long, you will not be able to get the short sticks

| Loops   | and | Strings |     |
Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks, such as searching for
text in documents. Repeating tasks without making errors is something that
| computers | do well and | people | do poorly. |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use while and for loops to add repetition
to your code. We’ll also take a first look at String methods and solve some
| interesting | problems. |           |     |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- | --- |
| 6.1         | The while | Statement |     |
Using a while statement, we can repeat the same code multiple times:
| int   | n = 3;  |     |     |
| ----- | ------- | --- | --- |
| while | (n > 0) | {   |     |
System.out.println(n);
|     | n = n - 1; |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | --- | --- |
}
System.out.println("Blastoff!");
Reading the code in English sounds like this: “Start with n set to 3. While n
is greater than 0, print the value of n, and reduce the value of n by 1. When
| you get | to 0, print Blastoff!” |     |     |

| The flow    | of execution | for       | a while | statement    | is as    | follows: |           |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------- | ------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1. Evaluate | the          | condition | in      | parentheses, | yielding | true     | or false. |
2. If the condition is false, skip the following statements in braces.
3. If the condition is true, execute the statements and go back to step 1.
This type of flow is called a loop, because the last step “loops back around”
| to the first. | Figure | ?? shows | this | idea         | using a flowchart. |         |       |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ---- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------- | ----- |
|               | Figure | 6.1:     | Flow | of execution | for                | a while | loop. |
The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that,
eventually, the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. Otherwise,
| the loop | will repeat | forever, | which | is called | an infinite |     | loop: |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- | --------- | ----------- | --- | ----- |
| int n    | = 3;        |          |       |           |             |     |       |
| while    | (n > 0)     | {        |       |           |             |     |       |
System.out.println(n);
| //  | n never | changes |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
This example will print the number 3 forever, or at least until you terminate
the program. An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the

| 6.2 Increment | and Decrement |     |     | 91  |
| ------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
observation that the directions on shampoo, “Lather, rinse, repeat,” are an
infinite loop.
In the first example, we can prove that the loop terminates when n is positive.
But in general, it is not so easy to tell whether a loop terminates. For example,
this loop continues until n is 1 (which makes the condition false):
| while (n != | 1) { |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
System.out.println(n);
| if (n | % 2 == 0) | {   | // n is even |     |
| ----- | --------- | --- | ------------ | --- |
n = n / 2;
| } else | {         |     | // n is odd |     |
| ------ | --------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
| n      | = 3 * n + | 1;  |             |     |
}
}
Each time through the loop, the program displays the value of n and then
checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, the value of n is divided by 2.
If it is odd, the value is replaced by 3n+1. For example, if the starting value
| is 3, the resulting | sequence | is 3, 10, | 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. |     |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------ | --- |
Sincensometimesincreasesandsometimesdecreases, thereisnoobviousproof
that n will ever reach 1 and that the program will ever terminate. For some
values of n, such as the powers of two, we can prove that it terminates. The
previous example ends with such a sequence, starting when n is 16 (or 24).
The hard question is whether this program terminates for all values of n. So
far, no one has been able to prove it or disprove it! For more information, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture.

Here is another while loop example; this one displays the numbers 1 to 5:
| int i = 1;  |      |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| while (i <= | 5) { |     |     |     |
System.out.println(i);
| i++; | // add 1 | to i |     |     |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | --- | --- |
}

92 Chapter 6 Loops and Strings
Assignments like i = i + 1 don’t often appear in loops, because Java pro-
vides a more concise way to add and subtract by one. Specifically, ++ is the
increment operator; it has the same effect as i = i + 1. And -- is the
decrement operator; it has the same effect as i = i - 1.
If you want to increment or decrement a variable by an amount other than 1,
you can use += and -=. For example, i += 2 increments i by 2:
int i = 2;
while (i <= 8) {
System.out.print(i + ", ");
i += 2; // add 2 to i
}
System.out.println("Who do we appreciate?");
And the output is as follows:
2, 4, 6, 8, Who do we appreciate?
6.3 The for Statement
The loops we have written so far have three parts in common. They start by
initializing a variable, they have a condition that depends on that variable,
and they do something inside the loop to update that variable.
Running the same code multiple times is called iteration. It’s so common
that there is another statement, the for loop, that expresses it more concisely.
For example, we can rewrite the 2-4-6-8 loop this way:
for (int i = 2; i <= 8; i += 2) {
System.out.print(i + ", ");
}
System.out.println("Who do we appreciate?");
for loops have three components in parentheses, separated by semicolons: the
initializer, the condition, and the update:
1. The initializer runs once at the very beginning of the loop. It is equiva-
lent to the line before the while statement.

| 6.3 | The | for | Statement |     |     |     |     |     |     | 93  |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
2. The condition is checked each time through the loop. If it is false, the
|     | loop | ends. | Otherwise, |     | the body | of the | loop | is executed | (again). |     |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ---- | ----------- | -------- | --- |
3. At the end of each iteration, the update runs, and we go back to step 2.
The for loop is often easier to read because it puts all the loop-related state-
ments at the top of the loop. Doing so allows you to focus on the statements
inside the loop body. Figure ?? illustrates for loops with a flowchart.
|     |     |     | Figure | 6.2: | Flow | of execution | for | a for loop. |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | ------ | ---- | ---- | ------------ | --- | ----------- | --- | --- |
There is another difference between for loops and while loops: if you declare
a variable in the initializer, it exists only the for loop. For example:
inside
|     | for | (int | n = 3; | n   | > 0; n--) | {   |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---- | ------ | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
System.out.println(n);
}
|     | System.out.println("n |     |     |     | is  | now " + | n); | // compiler | error |     |
| --- | --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | --- |
The last line tries to display n (for no reason other than demonstration), but
it won’t work. If you need to use a loop variable outside the loop, you have to
| declare |     | it outside | the | loop, | like this: |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
int n;
|     | for | (n = | 3; n | > 0; | n--) { |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
System.out.println(n);
}
|     | System.out.println("n |     |     |     | is  | now " + | n); |     |     |     |
| --- | --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Notice that the for statement does not say int n = 3. Rather, it simply
| initializes |     | the | existing | variable | n.  |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | --- | -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

94 Chapter 6 Loops and Strings
6.4 Nested Loops
Like conditional statements, loops can be nested one inside the other. Nested
loops allow you to iterate over two variables. For example, we can generate a
“multiplication table” like this:
for (int x = 1; x <= 10; x++) {
for (int y = 1; y <= 10; y++) {
System.out.printf("%4d", x * y);
}
System.out.println();
}
Variables like x and y are called loop variables, because they control the
execution of a loop. In this example, the first loop (for x) is known as the
“outer loop”, and the second loop (for y) is known as the “inner loop”.
Each loop repeats its corresponding statements 10 times. The outer loop
iterates from 1 to 10 only once, but the inner loop iterates from 1 to 10 each
of those 10 times. As a result, the printf method is invoked 100 times.
The format specifier %4d displays the value of x * y padded with spaces so it’s
four characters wide. Doing so causes the output to align vertically, regardless
of how many digits the numbers have:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
It’s important to realize that the output is displayed row by row. The inner
loop displays a single row of output, followed by a newline. The outer loop
iterates over the rows themselves. Another way to read nested loops, like the
ones in this example, is: “For each row x, and for each column y, ...”

6.5 Characters 95
| 6.5 | Characters |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Some of the most interesting problems in computer science involve searching
and manipulating text. In the next few sections, we’ll discuss how to apply
loops to strings. Although the examples are short, the techniques work the
| same whether | you | have | one | word | or one | million words. |     |
| ------------ | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | ------ | -------------- | --- |
Strings provide a method named charAt. It returns a char, a data type that
| stores an | individual | character          |     | (as | opposed | to strings | of them): |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | --- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| String    | fruit      | = "banana";        |     |     |         |            |           |
| char      | letter     | = fruit.charAt(0); |     |     |         |            |           |
The argument 0 means that we want the character at index 0. String indexes
range from 0 to 1, where is the length of the string. So the character
|          |           | n − |      | n   |     |       |     |
| -------- | --------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | ----- | --- |
| assigned | to letter | is  | 'b': |     |     |       |     |
|          |           |     |      | b a | n   | a n a |     |
|          |           |     |      | 0 1 | 2   | 3 4 5 |     |
Characters work like the other data types you have seen. You can compare
| them using               | relational |      | operators: |     |     |       |     |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- |
| if (letter               | ==         | 'A') | {          |     |     |       |     |
| System.out.println("It's |            |      |            |     | an  | A!"); |     |
}
Character literals, like 'A', appear in single quotes. Unlike string literals,
which appear in double quotes, character literals can contain only a single
character. Escape sequences, like '\t', are legal because they represent a
single character.
The increment and decrement operators also work with characters. So this
| loop displays           | the | letters | of the | alphabet: |      |     |     |
| ----------------------- | --- | ------- | ------ | --------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| System.out.print("Roman |     |         |        | alphabet: |      | "); |     |
| for (char               | c   | = 'A';  | c      | <= 'Z';   | c++) | {   |     |
System.out.print(c);
}
System.out.println();

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Java uses to represent characters, so strings can store text in other
Unicode
alphabets like Cyrillic and Greek, and non-alphabetic languages like Chinese.
You can read more about it at the Unicode website (https://unicode.org/).
In Unicode, each character is represented by a “code point”, which you can
think of as an integer. The code points for uppercase Greek letters run from
| 913 to                  | 937, so we              | can display | the Greek | alphabet | like this: |     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | --- |
| System.out.print("Greek |                         |             | alphabet: | ");      |            |     |
| for                     | (int i                  | = 913; i <= | 937; i++) | {        |            |     |
|                         | System.out.print((char) |             | i);       |          |            |     |
}
System.out.println();
This example uses a type cast to convert each integer (in the range) to the
corresponding character. Try running the code and see what happens.
| 6.6 | Which | Loop | to Use |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ---- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
for and while loops have the same capabilities; any for loop can be rewritten
as a while loop, and vice versa. For example, we could have printed letters of
| the alphabet            | by       | using a while | loop:     |     |     |     |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
| System.out.print("Roman |          |               | alphabet: | "); |     |     |
| char                    | c = 'A'; |               |           |     |     |     |
| while                   | (c <=    | 'Z') {        |           |     |     |     |
System.out.print(c);
c++;
}
System.out.println();
You might wonder when to use one or the other. It depends on whether you
| know how | many | times the loop | will repeat. |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | -------------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
A for loop is “definite”, which means we know, at the beginning of the loop,
how many times it will repeat. In the alphabet example, we know it will run

| 6.7 | String | Iteration |     |     |     | 97  |
| --- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
26 times. In that case, it’s better to use a for loop, which puts all of the loop
| control | code | on one line. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A while loop is “indefinite”, which means we don’t know how many times it
will repeat. For example, when validating user input as in Section 5.9, it’s
impossible to know how many times the user will enter a wrong value. In this
| case,                   | a while                 | loop is               | more appropriate: |           |                    |     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ------------------ | --- |
| System.out.print("Enter |                         |                       |                   | a number: | ");                |     |
| while                   |                         | (!in.hasNextDouble()) |                   | {         |                    |     |
|                         | String                  | word                  | = in.next();      |           |                    |     |
|                         | System.err.println(word |                       |                   | + "       | is not a number"); |     |

}

It’s easier to read the Scanner method calls when they’re not all on one line
of code.
| 6.7 | String | Iteration |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Strings provide a method called length that returns the number of characters
in the string. The following loop iterates the characters in fruit and displays
| them, | one  | on each line: |                     |     |        |     |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- | ------------------- | --- | ------ | --- |
| for   | (int | i = 0;        | i < fruit.length(); |     | i++) { |     |
|       | char | letter        | = fruit.charAt(i);  |     |        |     |
System.out.println(letter);
}
Because length is a method, you have to invoke it with parentheses (there
are no arguments). When i is equal to the length of the string, the condition
| becomes | false | and the | loop | terminates. |     |     |
| ------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | --- |
To find the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to do something like
the following:
| int  | length | = fruit.length();       |     |     |           |     |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------- | --- | --- | --------- | --- |
| char | last   | = fruit.charAt(length); |     |     | // wrong! |     |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | ----------------- |
This code compiles and runs, but invoking the charAt method throws a
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. The problem is that there is no sixth
letter in "banana". Since we started counting at 0, the six letters are indexed
from 0 to 5. To get the last character, you have to subtract 1 from length:
| int  | length | = fruit.length();     |     |     |       |     |            |     |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | ---------- | --- |
| char | last   | = fruit.charAt(length |     |     | - 1); |     | // correct |     |
Many string algorithms involve reading one string and building another. For
example, to reverse a string, we can concatenate one character at a time:
| public |        | static String     | reverse(String |     |      | s)    | {    |     |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------- | -------------- | --- | ---- | ----- | ---- | --- |
|        | String | r =               | "";            |     |      |       |      |     |
|        | for    | (int i            | = s.length()   | -   | 1; i | >= 0; | i--) | {   |
|        |        | r += s.charAt(i); |                |     |      |       |      |     |
}
|     | return | r;  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
The initial value of r is "", which is an empty string. The loop iterates the
indexes of s in reverse order. Each time through the loop, the += operator
appendsthenextcharactertor. Whentheloopexits,rcontainsthecharacters
from s in reverse order. So the result of reverse("banana") is "ananab".
| 6.8 | The | indexOf | Method |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Tosearchforaspecificcharacterinastring, youcouldwriteaforloopanduse
charAt as in the previous section. However, the String class already provides
| a method | for   | doing just            | that:     |     |     |     |         |     |
| -------- | ----- | --------------------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- |
| String   |       | fruit =               | "banana"; |     |     |     |         |     |
| int      | index | = fruit.indexOf('a'); |           |     |     | //  | returns | 1   |
This example finds the index of 'a' in the string. But the letter appears
three times, so it’s not obvious what indexOf might do. According to the
| documentation, |     | it returns | the index | of  | the first | appearance. |     |     |
| -------------- | --- | ---------- | --------- | --- | --------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
Tofindsubsequentappearances,youcanuseanotherversionofindexOf,which
takes a second argument that indicates where in the string to start looking:

6.9 Substrings 99
| int | index | =   | fruit.indexOf('a', |     |     |     | 2); // | returns | 3   |
| --- | ----- | --- | ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | ------ | ------- | --- |
To visualize how indexOf and other String methods work, it helps to draw a
picture like Figure ??. The previous code starts at index 2 (the first 'n') and
| finds | the next | 'a', | which  | is  | at index | 3.  |          |        |             |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ | --- | -------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
|       |          |      | fruit  |     | b        | a   | n        | a  n   | a           |
|       |          |      |        |     | 0        | 1   | 2        | 3 4    | 5           |
|       | Figure   | 6.3: | Memory |     | diagram  | for | a String | of six | characters. |
If the character happens to appear at the starting index, the starting index is
the answer. So fruit.indexOf('a', 5) returns 5. If the character does not
appear in the string, indexOf returns -1. Since indexes cannot be negative,
| this value | indicates |     | the | character |     | was not | found. |     |     |
| ---------- | --------- | --- | --- | --------- | --- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- |
You can also use indexOf to search for an entire string, not just a single
character. For example, the expression fruit.indexOf("nan") returns 2.

| --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In addition to searching strings, we often need to extract parts of strings. The
substring method returns a new string that copies letters from an existing
| string, | given              | a pair | of  | indexes: |            |     |       |     |     |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ | --- | -------- | ---------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| •       | fruit.substring(0, |        |     |          | 3) returns |     | "ban" |     |     |
| •       | fruit.substring(2, |        |     |          | 5) returns |     | "nan" |     |     |
| •       | fruit.substring(6, |        |     |          | 6) returns |     | ""    |     |     |
Notice that the character indicated by the second index is not included. Defin-
ing substring this way simplifies some common operations. For example,
to select a substring with length len, starting at index i, you could write
| fruit.substring(i, |     |     |     | i + len). |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Like most string methods, substring is overloaded. That is, there are other
versions of substring that have different parameters. If it’s invoked with one
| argument, |     | it returns | the | letters | from | that | index | to the end: |     |
| --------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----------- | --- |

| 100                  |     |     |     |         |          | Chapter | 6 Loops | and Strings |
| -------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| • fruit.substring(0) |     |     |     | returns | "banana" |         |         |             |
| • fruit.substring(2) |     |     |     | returns | "nana"   |         |         |             |
| • fruit.substring(6) |     |     |     | returns | ""       |         |         |             |
The first example returns a copy of the entire string. The second example
returns all but the first two characters. As the last example shows, substring
returns the empty string if the argument is the length of the string.
We could also use fruit.substring(2, fruit.length()) to get the result
"nana". But calling substring with one argument is more convenient when
| you want | the    | end of | the string. |     |     |     |     |     |

| 6.10     | String |        | Comparison  |     |     |     |     |     |
When comparing strings, it might be tempting to use the == and != operators.
But that will almost never work. The following code compiles and runs, but
| it always              | displays                  | Goodbye! |                  | regardless |     | what the | user types. |     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ----------- | --- |
| System.out.print("Play |                           |          |                  | again?     |     | ");      |             |     |
| String                 | answer                    |          | = in.nextLine(); |            |     |          |             |     |
| if                     | (answer                   | ==       | "yes")           | {          |     |          | // wrong!   |     |
|                        | System.out.println("Let's |          |                  |            |     | go!");   |             |     |
| } else                 | {                         |          |                  |            |     |          |             |     |
System.out.println("Goodbye!");
}
The problem is that the == operator checks whether the two operands refer to
the object. Even if the answer is "yes", it will refer to a different object
same
in memory than the literal string "yes" in the code. You’ll learn more about
| objects | and | references | in  | the next | chapter. |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
The correct way to compare strings is with the equals method, like this:
| if  | (answer.equals("yes"))    |     |     |     | {   |        |     |     |
| --- | ------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- |
|     | System.out.println("Let's |     |     |     |     | go!"); |     |     |
}

| 6.11 | String |     | Formatting |     |     |     |     |     | 101 |
| ---- | ------ | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
This example invokes equals on answer and passes "yes" as an argument.
The equals method returns true if the strings contain the same characters;
| otherwise, |     | it returns | false. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
If two strings differ, we can use compareTo to see which comes first in alpha-
betical order:
| String |                           | name1 | = "Alan                 | Turing";   |     |       |         |           |     |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --- | ----- | ------- | --------- | --- |
| String |                           | name2 | = "Ada                  | Lovelace"; |     |       |         |           |     |
| int    | diff                      | =     | name1.compareTo(name2); |            |     |       |         |           |     |
| if     | (diff                     | <     | 0) {                    |            |     |       |         |           |     |
|        | System.out.println("name1 |       |                         |            |     | comes | before  | name2."); |     |
| }      | else                      | if    | (diff >                 | 0) {       |     |       |         |           |     |
|        | System.out.println("name2 |       |                         |            |     | comes | before  | name1."); |     |
| }      | else                      | {     |                         |            |     |       |         |           |     |
|        | System.out.println("The   |       |                         |            |     | names | are the | same.");  |     |
}
The return value from compareTo is the difference between the first characters
in the strings that are not the same. In the preceding code, compareTo returns
positive 8, because the second letter of "Ada" comes before the second letter
| of "Alan" |     | by eight | letters. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
If the first string (the one on which the method is invoked) comes earlier in
the alphabet, the difference is negative. If it comes later in the alphabet, the
difference is positive. If the strings are equal, their difference is zero.
Both equals and compareTo are case-sensitive. In Unicode, uppercase letters
| come | before | lowercase | letters.   |     | So "Ada" | comes | before | "ada". |     |

In Section 3.5, we learned how to use System.out.printf to display format-
ted output. Sometimes programs need to create strings that are formatted a
certain way, but not display them immediately (or ever). For example, the
| following |     | method | returns | a time | string | in 12-hour | format: |     |     |
| --------- | --- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- |

102 Chapter 6 Loops and Strings
public static String timeString(int hour, int minute) {
String ampm;
if (hour < 12) {
ampm = "AM";
if (hour == 0) {
hour = 12; // midnight
}
} else {
ampm = "PM";
hour = hour - 12;
}
return String.format("%02d:%02d %s", hour, minute, ampm);
}
String.format takes the same arguments as System.out.printf: a for-
mat specifier followed by a sequence of values. The main difference is that
System.out.printf displays the result on the screen. String.format creates
a new string but does not display anything.
In this example, the format specifier %02d means “two-digit integer padded
with zeros”, so timeString(19, 5) returns the string "07:05 PM". As an
exercise, try writing two nested for loops (in main) that invoke timeString
and display all possible times over a 24-hour period.
Be sure to skim through the documentation for String. Knowing what other
methods are there will help you avoid reinventing the wheel. The easiest way
to find documentation for Java classes is to do a web search for “Java” and the
name of the class.

its square root. One way to do that is to start with a rough guess about the
| answer, | , and | then | improve | the | guess | by using |     | this formula: |     |
| ------- | ----- | ---- | ------- | --- | ----- | -------- | --- | ------------- | --- |
x
0
|     |     |     |     | x   | = (x | +a/x | )/2 |     |     |

|     |     |     |     |     | 1 0  |      | 0   |     |     |
For example, if we want to find the square root of 9, and we start with 6,
x =

| then |               |     |     | 3.75, | which | is closer. | We  | can repeat | the procedure, |

using x to calculate x , and so on. In this case, x = 3.075 and x = 3.00091.

Up to this point, the only variables we have used were for individual values
such as numbers or strings. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to store multiple
values of the same type by using a single variable. This language feature will
enable you to write programs that manipulate larger amounts of data.
For example, Exercise asked you to check whether every letter in a string

| loops | through | the   | string | 26    | times,            | once | for each lowercase |     | letter:        |

This “nested loops” approach is inefficient, especially when the string is long.
For example, there are more than 3 million characters in War and Peace; to
process the whole book, the nested loop would run about 80 million times.
Anotheralgorithmwouldinitialize26variablestozero, loopthroughthestring
one time, and use a giant if statement to update the variable for each letter.
| But | who wants |     | to declare | 26  | variables? |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
That’s where arrays come in. We can use a single variable to store 26 integers.
Rather than use an if statement to update each value, we can use arithmetic

| 108 |     |     |     | Chapter | 7   | Arrays | and References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ------ | -------------- |
to update the nth value directly. We will present this algorithm at the end of
the chapter.
| 7.1 | Creating | Arrays |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
An array is a sequence of values; the values in the array are called elements.
You can make an array of ints, doubles, Strings, or any other type, but all
| the values | in an array | must | have | the same | type. |     |     |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- |
To create an array, you have to declare a variable with an array type and then
create the array itself. Array types look like other Java types, except they are
followed by square brackets ([]). For example, the following lines declare that
| counts   | is an “integer | array” | and values |     | is a “double | array”: |     |
| -------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------- | --- | ------------ | ------- | --- |
| int[]    | counts;        |        |            |     |              |         |     |
| double[] | values;        |        |            |     |              |         |     |
To create the array itself, you have to use the new operator, which you first
saw in Section 3.2. The new operator allocates memory for the array and
| automatically | initializes | all           | of its | elements | to zero: |     |     |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | --- | --- |
| counts        | = new       | int[4];       |        |          |          |     |     |
| values        | = new       | double[size]; |        |          |          |     |     |
The first assignment makes counts refer to an array of four integers. The
second makes values refer to an array of doubles, but the number of elements
| depends | on the value | of size | (at | the time | the array | is created). |     |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- | --- | -------- | --------- | ------------ | --- |
Of course, you can also declare the variable and create the array with a single
line of code:
| int[]    | counts | = new int[4]; |               |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| double[] | values | = new         | double[size]; |     |     |     |     |
You can use any integer expression for the size of an array, as long as the value
is nonnegative. If you try to create an array with -4 elements, for example,
you will get a NegativeArraySizeException. An array with zero elements is
| allowed, | and there | are special | uses | for such | arrays. |     |     |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- |

| 7.2 Accessing |     | Elements |     |     |     |     |     |     | 109 |
| ------------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
You can initialize an array with a comma-separated sequence of elements en-
| closed in | braces, | like this: |        |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| int[]     | a =     | {1, 2,     | 3, 4}; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
This statement creates an array variable, a, and makes it refer to an array
| with four     | elements. |     |          |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7.2 Accessing |           |     | Elements |     |     |     |     |     |     |
When you create an array with the new operator, the elements are initialized
to zero. Figure shows a memory diagram of the counts array so far.
??
|     |     | counts |             |     | 0       | 0   | 0         | 0      |     |

things. As you’ll soon see, we can assign a different variable to refer to the
same array, and we can change the value of counts to refer to a different array.
The boldface numbers inside the boxes are the elements of the array. The
lighter numbers outside the boxes are the used to identify each loca-
indexes
tion in the array. As with strings, the index of the first element is 0, not 1. For
this reason, we sometimes refer to the first element as the “zeroth” element.
| The [] operator         |     | selects     | elements | from   | an      | array:         |     |                 |     |
| ----------------------- | --- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ------- | -------------- | --- | --------------- | --- |
| System.out.println("The |     |             |          | zeroth | element |                | is  | " + counts[0]); |     |
| You can use             | the | [] operator | anywhere |        | in      | an expression: |     |                 |     |
| counts[0]               |     | = 7;        |          |        |         |                |     |                 |     |
| counts[1]               |     | = counts[0] | *        | 2;     |         |                |     |                 |     |
counts[2]++;
| counts[3] |     | -= 60; |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| ------ | -------- | ------------------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
You can use any expression as an index, as long as it has type int. One of the
most common ways to index an array is with a loop variable. For example:
| int   | i = 0;  |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| while | (i < 4) | {   |     |     |     |
System.out.println(counts[i]);
i++;
}
This while loop counts up from 0 to 4. When i is 4, the condition fails and
the loop terminates. So the body of the loop is executed only when i is 0, 1,
| 2, or 3. | In this context, | the variable | name i | is short for | “index”. |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | -------- |
Each time through the loop, we use i as an index into the array, displaying
the ith element. This type of array processing is usually written as a for loop:
| for | (int i = | 0; i < 4; i++) | {   |     |     |
| --- | -------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
System.out.println(counts[i]);
}
For the counts array, the only legal indexes are 0, 1, 2, and 3. If the index is
negativeorgreaterthan3,theresultisanArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
| 7.3 | Displaying | Arrays |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
You can use println to display an array, but it probably doesn’t do what you
| would | like. For example, | say you   | print an array | like this: |     |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------- | -------------- | ---------- | --- |
| int[] | a = {1,            | 2, 3, 4}; |                |            |     |
System.out.println(a);
| The output | is something | like this: |     |     |     |

The bracket indicates that the value is an array, I stands for “integer”, and the
| rest | represents |     | the address | of the | array | in memory. |     |     |
| ---- | ---------- | --- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- |
If we want to display the elements of the array, we can do it ourselves:
| public |                      | static              | void | printArray(int[] |        | a)     | {   |     |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- |
|        | System.out.print("{" |                     |      | +                | a[0]); |        |     |     |
|        | for                  | (int                | i =  | 1; i < a.length; |        | i++)   | {   |     |
|        |                      | System.out.print(", |      |                  | " +    | a[i]); |     |     |
}
System.out.println("}");
}
| Given | the | previous | array, | the output | of  | printArray | is as follows: |     |
| ----- | --- | -------- | ------ | ---------- | --- | ---------- | -------------- | --- |
| {1,   | 2,  | 3,       | 4}     |            |     |            |                |     |
The Java library includes a class, java.util.Arrays, that provides methods
for working with arrays. One of them, toString, returns a string representa-
tion of an array. After importing Arrays, we can invoke toString like this:
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
| And | the output |     | is shown | here: |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [1, | 2,         | 3,  | 4]       |       |     |     |     |     |
Notice that Arrays.toString uses square brackets instead of curly braces.
| But | it beats | writing | your | own printArray |     | method. |     |     |

| 7.4 | Copying  |         |      | Arrays         |     |         |     |     |
As explained in Section ??, array variables contain to arrays. When
references
you make an assignment to an array variable, it simply copies the reference.
| But      | it doesn’t |     | copy the | array itself. | For | example: |     |     |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ------------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- |
| double[] |            | a   | = new    | double[3];    |     |          |     |     |
| double[] |            | b   | = a;     |               |     |          |     |     |

These statements create an array of three doubles and make two different
| variables | refer to it, as | shown in | Figure ??. |     |     |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
Any changes made through either variable will be seen by the other. For
example, if we set a[0] = 17.0, and then display b[0], the result is 17.0.
Because a and b are different names for the same thing, they are sometimes
called aliases.
If you actually want to copy the array, not just the reference, you have to
create a new array and copy the elements from one to the other, like this:
| double[] | b = new | double[3];  |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
| for (int | i = 0;  | i < 3; i++) | {   |     |     |
| b[i]     | = a[i]; |             |     |     |     |
}
java.util.Arrays provides a method named copyOf that performs this task
| for you. | So you can replace   | the previous | code | with one line: |     |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| double[] | b = Arrays.copyOf(a, |              | 3);  |                |     |
The second parameter is the number of elements you want to copy, so copyOf
can also be used to copy part of an array. Figure shows the state of the
??
| array variables | after | invoking Arrays.copyOf. |          |     |     |
| --------------- | ----- | ----------------------- | -------- | --- | --- |

|                 |       |                         | 0        | 1 2 |     |
|                 |       | b                       | 17.0 0.0 | 0.0 |     |
|                 |       |                         | 0        | 1 2 |     |

The examples so far work only if the array has three elements. It is better
to generalize the code to work with arrays of any size. We can do that by
| replacing | the  | magic   | number, |                   | 3, with | a.length: |     |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------- | --- |
| double[]  |      | b =     | new     | double[a.length]; |         |           |     |
| for       | (int | i =     | 0; i    | < a.length;       |         | i++) {    |     |
|           | b[i] | = a[i]; |         |                   |         |           |     |
}
Allarrayshaveabuilt-inconstant,length, thatstoresthenumberofelements.
In contrast to String.length(), which is a method, a.length is a constant.
The expression a.length may look like a method invocation, but there are no
| parentheses |     | and | no arguments. |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The last time the loop gets executed, i is a.length - 1, which is the index
of the last element. When i is equal to a.length, the condition fails and
the body is not executed—which is a good thing, because trying to access
| a[a.length] |     | would | throw | an  | exception. |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ----- | ----- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- |
Of course, we can replace the loop altogether by using Arrays.copyOf and
a.length for the second argument. The following line produces the same
| result   | shown | in Figure |                  | ??: |     |            |     |
| -------- | ----- | --------- | ---------------- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- |
| double[] |       | b =       | Arrays.copyOf(a, |     |     | a.length); |     |
The Arrays class provides many other useful methods like Arrays.compare,
Arrays.equals, Arrays.fill, and Arrays.sort. Take a moment to read the
| documentation |            | by  | searching |        | the web | for java.util.Arrays. |     |

Many computations can be implemented by looping through the elements of
an array and performing an operation on each element. Looping through the
| elements | of   | an array | is    | called      | a traversal: |        |     |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------ | ------ | --- |
| int[]    | a    | = {1,    | 2,    | 3, 4,       | 5};          |        |     |
| for      | (int | i =      | 0; i  | < a.length; |              | i++) { |     |
|          | a[i] | *=       | a[i]; |             |              |        |     |
}

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | ------ | -------------- |
This example traverses an array and squares each element. At the end of the
| loop, | the array | has | the values |     | {1, 4, | 9, 16, | 25}. |     |     |
| ----- | --------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------ | ------ | ---- | --- | --- |
Another common pattern is a search, which involves traversing an array and
“searching” for a particular element. For example, the following method takes
an array and a value, and it returns the index where the value appears:
| public |     | static | int       | search(double[] |               |     | array, | double | target) { |
| ------ | --- | ------ | --------- | --------------- | ------------- | --- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
|        | for | (int   | i = 0;    | i <             | array.length; |     | i++)   | {      |           |
|        |     | if     | (array[i] | ==              | target)       | {   |        |        |           |
|        |     |        | return    | i;              |               |     |        |        |           |
}
}
|     | return |     | -1; // | not | found |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
If we find the target value in the array, we return its index immediately. If the
loop exits without finding the target, it returns -1, a special value chosen to
indicate a failed search. (This code is essentially what the String.indexOf
| method | does.) |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The following code searches an array for the value 1.23, which is the third
| element. | Because |       | array indexes |     | start  | at 0, the | output | is  | 2:  |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | ------------- | --- | ------ | --------- | ------ | --- | --- |
| double[] |         | array | = {3.14,      |     | -55.0, | 1.23,     | -0.8}; |     |     |
| int      | index   | =     | search(array, |     | 1.23); |           |        |     |     |
System.out.println(index);
Another common traversal is a reduce operation, which “reduces” an array
of values down to a single value. Examples include the sum or product of the
elements, the minimum, and the maximum. The following method takes an
| array  | and    | returns | the sum      | of its       | elements:     |     |        |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- |
| public |        | static  | double       | sum(double[] |               |     | array) | {   |     |
|        | double |         | total =      | 0.0;         |               |     |        |     |     |
|        | for    | (int    | i = 0;       | i <          | array.length; |     | i++)   | {   |     |
|        |        | total   | += array[i]; |              |               |     |        |     |     |
}
|     | return |     | total; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}

| --- | ------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Before the loop, we initialize total to 0. Each time through the loop, we
update total by adding one element from the array. At the end of the loop,
total contains the sum of the elements. A variable used this way is sometimes
called an accumulator, because it “accumulates” the running total.

Most computer programs do the same thing every time they run; programs
like that are called deterministic. Usually, determinism is a good thing,
since we expect the same calculation to yield the same result. But for some
applications, wewantthecomputertobeunpredictable. Gamesareanobvious

Making a program nondeterministic turns out to be hard, because it’s im-
possible for a computer to generate truly random numbers. But there are algo-
rithmsthatgenerateunpredictablesequencescalledpseudorandomnumbers.
| For | most applications, |     |     | they are | as good | as random. |     |     |

If you generate a long series of random numbers, every value should appear, at
least approximately, the same number of times. One way to test this behavior
of nextInt is to generate a large number of values, store them in an array,
| and | count | the number |     | of times | each value | occurs. |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- |
The following method creates an int array and fills it with random numbers
between 0 and 99. The argument specifies the desired size of the array, and
| the    | return | value  | is a reference         |                 | to the new | array: |     |     |

}
|     | return |     | a;  |     |     |     |     |     |

The following main method generates an array and displays it by using the
printArray method from Section ??. We could have used Arrays.toString,
| but    | we like | seeing | curly | braces          | instead | of square | brackets: |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | --- | --- |
| public |         | static | void  | main(String[]   |         |           | args) {   |     |     |
|        | int[]   | array  | =     | randomArray(8); |         |           |           |     |     |
printArray(array);
}
Each time you run the program, you should get different values. The output
| will | look something |     | like | this:       |     |     |     |     |     |

If these values were exam scores—and they would be pretty bad exam scores
in that case—the teacher might present them to the class in the form of a
histogram. In statistics, a histogram is a set of counters that keeps track of

scored in the 90s, the 80s, etc. To do that, we can traverse the array and count

| --- | ------ | ----------- | --- | --------- | --- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- |
The following method takes an array and two integers. It returns the number

This pattern should look familiar: it is another reduce operation. Notice that
low is included in the range (>=), but high is excluded (<). This design keeps
| us from | counting |     | any | scores | twice. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | -------- | --- | --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Now we can count the number of scores in each grade range. We add the
| following | code | to                | our                | main | method: |       |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| int[]     |      | scores            | = randomArray(30); |      |         |       |     |     |     |
| int       | a    | = inRange(scores, |                    |      | 90,     | 100); |     |     |     |
| int       | b    | = inRange(scores, |                    |      | 80,     | 90);  |     |     |     |
| int       | c    | = inRange(scores, |                    |      | 70,     | 80);  |     |     |     |
| int       | d    | = inRange(scores, |                    |      | 60,     | 70);  |     |     |     |
| int       | f    | = inRange(scores, |                    |      | 0,      | 60);  |     |     |     |
This code is repetitive, but it is acceptable as long as the number of ranges is
small. Supposewewantedtokeeptrackofthenumberoftimeseachindividual
| score | appears. | Then | we                | would | have | to write | 100 lines | of code: |     |

| int   | count0   |      | = inRange(scores, |       |      | 0,       | 1);       |          |     |
| int   | count1   |      | = inRange(scores, |       |      | 1,       | 2);       |          |     |
| int   | count2   |      | = inRange(scores, |       |      | 2,       | 3);       |          |     |
...
| int | count99 |     | = inRange(scores, |     |     | 99, | 100); |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
What we need is a way to store 100 counters, preferably so we can use an
index to access them. Wait a minute—that’s exactly what an array does.
The following fragment creates an array of 100 counters, one for each possible
score. It loops through the scores and uses inRange to count how many times
each score appears. Then it stores the results in the counts array:
| int[] |           | counts | = new | int[100];          |     |     |            |     |     |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | ----- | ------------------ | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| for   | (int      | i      | = 0;  | i < counts.length; |     |     | i++) {     |     |     |
|       | counts[i] |        | =     | inRange(scores,    |     |     | i, i + 1); |     |     |
}
Notice that we are using the loop variable i three times: as an index into the
| counts | array, | and | in the | last | two | arguments | of inRange. |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | --- | ------ | ---- | --- | --------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
The code works, but it is not as efficient as it could be. Every time the loop
invokes inRange, it traverses the entire array. It would be better to make a
| single | pass | through | the | scores | array. |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |

For each score, we already know which range it falls in—the score itself. We
canusethatvaluetoincrementthecorrespondingcounter. Thiscodetraverses
| the array | of     | scores | only once             | to generate | the | histogram: |     |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------- | ----------- | --- | ---------- | --- |
| int[]     | counts |        | = new int[100];       |             |     |            |     |
| for       | (int   | i =    | 0; i < scores.length; |             |     | i++) {     |     |
|           | int    | index  | = scores[i];          |             |     |            |     |
counts[index]++;
}
Each time through the loop, it selects one element from scores and uses it
as an index to increment the corresponding element of counts. Because this
code traverses the array of scores only once, it is much more efficient.

Since traversing arrays is so common, Java provides an alternative syntax that
makes the code more compact. Consider a for loop that displays the elements
| of an array |      | on separate | lines:                |     |     |        |     |

| We could | rewrite | the   | loop like | this: |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| for      | (int    | value | : values) | {     |     |     |     |
System.out.println(value);
}
This statement is called an loop, also known as the “for each”
|     |     |     | enhanced |     | for |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
loop. You can read the code as, “for each value in values”. It’s conventional
tousepluralnounsforarrayvariablesandsingularnounsforelementvariables.
Notice how the single line for (int value : values) replaces the first two
lines of the standard for loop. It hides the details of iterating each index of
| the array, | and | instead, | focuses | on the | values | themselves. |     |

Using the enhanced for loop, and removing the temporary variable, we can
write the histogram code from the previous section more concisely:
| int[]    | counts = | new int[100]; |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| for (int | score    | : scores)     | {   |     |     |     |
counts[score]++;
}
Enhanced for loops often make the code more readable, especially for accu-
mulating values. But they are not helpful when you need to refer to the index,
| as in search | operations:   |          |        |               |       |     |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------- | ----- | --- |
| for (double  | d             | : array) | {      |               |       |     |
| if           | (d == target) |          | {      |               |       |     |
|              | // array      | contains | d, but | we don't know | where |     |
}
}

We now return to the example from the beginning of the chapter and present
a solution to Exercise using arrays. Here is the problem again:
??
A word is said to be a “doubloon” if every letter that appears in
| thewordappearsexactlytwice. |     |     | WriteamethodcalledisDoubloon |     |     |     |
| --------------------------- | --- | --- | ---------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
that takes a string and checks whether it is a doubloon. To ignore
| case, | invoke the | toLowerCase | method | before checking. |     |     |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------- | --- | --- |
BasedontheapproachfromSection??,wewillcreateanarrayof26integersto
count how many times each letter appears. We convert the string to lowercase,
so that we can treat 'A' and 'a' (for example) as the same letter.
| int[]  | counts = | new int[26];     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| String | lower =  | s.toLowerCase(); |     |     |     |     |
We can use a for loop to iterate each character in the string. To update
the counts array, we need to compute the index that corresponds to each
character. Fortunately, Java allows you to perform arithmetic on characters:

| 120 |      |        |      |                     | Chapter |     | 7 Arrays | and References |
| --- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------------------- | ------- | --- | -------- | -------------- |
| for | (int | i      | = 0; | i < lower.length(); |         |     | i++) {   |                |
|     | char | letter |      | = lower.charAt(i);  |         |     |          |                |
|     | int  | index  | =    | letter              | - 'a';  |     |          |                |
counts[index]++;
}
If letter is 'a', the value of index is 0; if letter is 'b', the value of index
| is 1, | and | so on. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Then we use index to increment the corresponding element of counts. At the
end of the loop, counts contains a histogram of the letters in the string lower.
We can simplify this code with an enhanced for loop, but it doesn’t work with
strings; we have to convert lower to an array of characters, like this:
| for | (char | letter |     | : lower.toCharArray()) |        |     | {   |     |
| --- | ----- | ------ | --- | ---------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
|     | int   | index  | =   | letter                 | - 'a'; |     |     |     |
counts[index]++;
}
Once we have the counts, we can use a second for loop to check whether each
| letter | appears | zero   | or     | two times: |          |            |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| for    | (int    | count  | :      | counts)    | {        |            |     |     |
|        | if      | (count | !=     | 0 &&       | count != | 2)         | {   |     |
|        |         | return | false; |            | // not   | a doubloon |     |     |
}
}
| return |     | true; | //  | is a | doubloon |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ----- | --- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
If we find a count that is neither 0 or 2, we know the word is not a doubloon
and we can return immediately. If we make it all the way through the for
loop, we know that all counts are 0 or 2, which means the word is a doubloon.
Pulling together the code fragments, and adding some comments and test
| cases, | here’s | the | entire | program: |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | --- | ------ | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

7.10 Vocabulary 121
public class Doubloon {
public static boolean isDoubloon(String s) {
// count the number of times each letter appears
int[] counts = new int[26];
String lower = s.toLowerCase();
for (char letter : lower.toCharArray()) {
int index = letter - 'a';
counts[index]++;
}
// determine whether the given word is a doubloon
for (int count : counts) {
if (count != 0 && count != 2) {
return false;
}
}
return true;
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(isDoubloon("Mama")); // true
System.out.println(isDoubloon("Lama")); // false
}
}
This example uses methods, if statements, for loops, arithmetic and logical
operators, integers, characters, strings, booleans, and arrays. We hope you’ll
take a second to appreciate how much you’ve learned!

In this chapter, we explore one of the most magical things that a method can
do: invoke to solve a smaller version of the problem. A method
|               | itself        |                      |         | same |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ---- |
| that invokes  | itself        | is called recursive. |         |      |
| 8.1 Recursive |               | Void                 | Methods |      |
| Consider      | the following | example:             |         |      |
| public        | static        | void countdown(int   | n) {    |      |
| if            | (n ==         | 0) {                 |         |      |
System.out.println("Blastoff!");
| }   | else { |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
System.out.println(n);
|     | countdown(n | - 1); |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | ----- | --- | --- |
}
}
The name of the method is countdown; it takes a single integer as a parameter.
If the parameter is 0, it displays the word Blastoff!. Otherwise, it displays
the number and then invokes itself, passing n - 1 as the argument.

|     |     | The       | countdown     | that      | got       | n ==       | 2 returns.    |            |     |     |
|     | The | countdown |               | that got  | n ==      | 3 returns. |               |            |     |     |
And then you’re back in main. So the total output looks like this:
3

Blastoff!
As a second example, we’ll rewrite the methods newLine and threeLine from
| Section |        | 4.1. Here | they | are again: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|         | public | static    | void | newLine()  |     | {   |     |     |     |     |
System.out.println();
}
|     | public | static | void | threeLine() |     |     | {   |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ---- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
newLine();
newLine();
newLine();
}
Althoughthesemethodswork, theywouldnothelpifwewantedtodisplaytwo
newlines, or maybe 100. A more general alternative would be the following:

| ------------- | ------- | --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| public        | static  | void nLines(int | n) { |     |     |
|               | if (n > | 0) {            |      |     |     |
System.out.println();
|     | nLines(n | - 1); |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
}
}
This method takes an integer, n, as a parameter and displays n newlines. The
structure is similar to countdown. As long as n is greater than 0, it displays
a newline and then invokes itself to display (n−1) additional newlines. The
total number of newlines is 1+(n−1), which is just what we wanted: n.
| 8.2 | Recursive | Stack | Diagrams |     |     |
| --- | --------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
In Section 4.5, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program
during a method invocation. The same kind of diagram can make it easier to
| interpret | a recursive | method. |     |     |     |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
Remember that every time a method gets called, Java creates a new frame
that contains the method’s parameters and variables. Figure ?? is a stack
| diagram | for countdown, | called | with n == 3. |     |     |
| ------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------ | --- | --- |
main
countdown n 3
countdown n 2
countdown n 1
countdown n 0
|     | Figure | 8.1: Stack diagram | for the countdown | program. |     |
| --- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------- | --- |
By convention, the frame for main is at the top, and the stack of other frames
grows down. That way, we can draw stack diagrams on paper without needing
to guess how far they will grow. The frame for main is empty because main

130 Chapter 8 Recursive Methods
does not have any variables. (It has the parameter args, but since we’re not
using it, we left it out of the diagram.)
There are four frames for countdown, each with a different value for the pa-
rameter n. The last frame, with n == 0, is called the base case. It does not
make a recursive call, so there are no more frames below it.
If there is no base case in a recursive method, or if the base case is never
reached, the stack would grow forever—at least in theory. In practice, the size
ofthestackislimited. Ifyouexceedthelimit, yougetaStackOverflowError.
For example, here is a recursive method without a base case:
public static void forever(String s) {
System.out.println(s);
forever(s);
}
This method displays the given string until the stack overflows, at which point
itthrowsanerror. Trythisexampleonyourcomputer—youmightbesurprised
by how long the error message is!
8.3 Value-Returning Methods
To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned, let’s
look at methods that evaluate recursively defined mathematical functions.
A recursive definition is similar to a “circular” definition, in the sense that
the definition refers to the thing being defined. Of course, a truly circular
definition is not very useful:
recursive:
An adjective used to describe a method that is recursive.
Ifyousawthatdefinitioninthedictionary, youmightbeannoyed. Thenagain,
if you search for “recursion” on Google, it displays “Did you mean: recursion”
as an inside joke. People fall for that link all the time.

| 8.3 Value-Returning |     |     | Methods |     |     | 131 |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
Many mathematical functions are defined recursively, because that is often the
simplest way. For example, the factorial of an integer n, which is written n!,
| is defined | like | this: |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
0! = 1
n! = n·(n−1)!
Don’t confuse the mathematical symbol !, which means factorial, with the
Java operator !, which means not. This definition says that factorial(0) is
| 1, and | factorial(n) |     | is n * | factorial(n | - 1). |     |
| ------ | ------------ | --- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | --- |
Sofactorial(3)is3 * factorial(2); factorial(2)is2 * factorial(1);
factorial(1) is 1 * factorial(0); and factorial(0) is 1. Putting it all
| together, | we get | 3 * | 2 * 1 | * 1, which | is 6. |     |
| --------- | ------ | --- | ----- | ---------- | ----- | --- |
If you can formulate a recursive definition of something, you can easily write
a Java method to evaluate it. The first step is to decide what the parameters
and return type are. Since factorial is defined for integers, the method takes
| an int | as a parameter |     | and               | returns an | int: |     |
| ------ | -------------- | --- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---- | --- |
| public | static         |     | int factorial(int |            | n) { |     |
|        | return         | 0;  | // stub           |            |      |     |
}
Next, we think about the base case. If the argument happens to be 0, we
return 1:
| public | static |       | int factorial(int |     | n) { |     |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------- | --- | ---- | --- |
|        | if (n  | == 0) | {                 |     |      |     |
|        | return |       | 1;                |     |      |     |
}
|     | return | 0;  | // stub |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
}
Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to
| find the | factorial | of  | n−1, and | then multiply | it by n: |     |
| -------- | --------- | --- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | --- |

132 Chapter 8 Recursive Methods
public static int factorial(int n) {
if (n == 0) {
return 1;
}
int recurse = factorial(n - 1);
int result = n * recurse;
return result;
}
To illustrate what is happening, we’ll use the temporary variables recurse
and result. In each method call, recurse stores the factorial of n−1, and
result stores the factorial of n.
TheflowofexecutionforthisprogramissimilartocountdownfromSection??.
If we invoke factorial with the value 3:
Since 3 is not 0, we skip the first branch and calculate the factorial
of n−1...
Since 2 is not 0, we skip the first branch and calculate
the factorial of n−1...
Since 1 is not 0, we skip the first branch and
calculate the factorial of n−1...
Since 0 is 0, we take the first branch and
return the value 1 immediately.
The return value (1) gets multiplied by n, which
is 1, and the result is returned.
The return value (1) gets multiplied by n, which is 2,
and the result is returned.
Thereturnvalue(2)getsmultipliedbyn, whichis3, andtheresult,
6, is returned to whatever invoked factorial(3).
Figure ?? shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of method
invocations. The return values are shown being passed up the stack. Notice
that recurse and result do not exist in the last frame, because when n == 0,
the code that declares them does not execute.

Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly
become overwhelming. Another way to understand recursion is the leap of
faith: when you come to a method invocation, instead of following the flow
of execution, you assume that the method works correctly and returns the
| appropriate |     | value. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use methods
in the Java library. When you invoke Math.cos or System.out.println, you
don’t think about the implementations of those methods. You just assume
| that | they | work | properly. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The same is true of other methods. For example, consider the method from
Section 5.8 that determines whether an integer has only one digit:
| public |        | static | boolean |     | isSingleDigit(int |     | x)  | {   |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return |        | x >     | -10 | && x < 10;        |     |     |     |     |
}
Once you convince yourself that this method is correct—by examining and
testing the code—you can just use the method without ever looking at the
| implementation |     |     | again. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------------- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Recursive methods are no different. When you get to a recursive call, don’t
think about the flow of execution. Instead, assume that the recursive call
| produces |     | the desired |     | result. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ----------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 134 |     |     |     |     | Chapter | 8 Recursive | Methods |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
Forexample, “AssumingthatIcanfindthefactorialofn−1, canIcomputethe
factorial of n?” Yes you can, by multiplying by n. Here’s an implementation
| of factorial |     | with   | the temporary     | variables | removed: |     |     |
| ------------ | --- | ------ | ----------------- | --------- | -------- | --- | --- |
| public       |     | static | int factorial(int |           | n) {     |     |     |
|              | if  | (n ==  | 0) {              |           |          |     |     |
|              |     | return | 1;                |           |          |     |     |
}
|     | return |     | n * factorial(n | -   | 1); |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
Notice how similar this version is to the original mathematical definition:
0! = 1
n! = n·(n−1)!
Of course, it is strange to assume that the method works correctly when you
have not finished writing it. But that’s why it’s called a leap of faith!
Another common recursively defined mathematical function is the Fibonacci
| sequence, | which |              | has the following | definition:                     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|           |       | fibonacci(1) |                   | = 1                             |     |     |     |
|           |       | fibonacci(2) |                   | = 1                             |     |     |     |
|           |       | fibonacci(n) |                   | = fibonacci(n−1)+fibonacci(n−2) |     |     |     |
Notice that each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci
| numbers. | Translated |        | into Java,        | this function | is   | as follows: |     |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| public   |            | static | int fibonacci(int |               | n) { |             |     |
|          | if         | (n ==  | 1 || n            | == 2) {       |      |             |     |
|          |            | return | 1;                |               |      |             |     |
}
|     | return |     | fibonacci(n | - 1) + | fibonacci(n | - 2); |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | --- |
}
If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for small values of n, your
head will explode. But if we take a leap of faith and assume that the two
recursive invocations work correctly, then it is clear, looking at the definition,
| that | our implementation |     | is  | correct. |     |     |     |

| 8.5 Counting |     | Up Recursively |     |     |     |
The countdown example in Section has three parts: (1) it checks the base
??
case, (2) it displays something, and (3) it makes a recursive call. What do you
think happens if you reverse steps 2 and 3, making the recursive call
before
displaying?
| public | static void | countup(int | n) { |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| if     | (n == 0)    | {           |      |     |     |
System.out.println("Blastoff!");
| }   | else {    |       |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | countup(n | - 1); |     |     |     |
System.out.println(n);
}
}
The stack diagram is the same as before, and the method is still called
n
times. But now the System.out.println happens just before each recursive
| call returns. | As a result, | it counts | instead | of down: |     |

You are probably aware that computers can store only 1s and 0s. That’s
because processors and memory are made up of billions of tiny on-off switches.

|     | Table 8.1: | The first | eight binary | numbers.    |         |
In decimal there are 10 digits, and the written representation of numbers is
based on powers of 10. For example, the number 456 has 4 in the 100’s place,
5 in the 10’s place, and 6 in the 1’s place. So the value is 400 + 50 + 6:
|     |     | 4       | 5 6 |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | 102 101 | 100 |     |     |
In binary there are two digits, and the written representation of numbers is
based on powers of two. For example, the number 10111 has 1 in the 16’s
place, 0 in the 8’s place, 1 in the 4’s place, 1 in the 2’s place, and 1 in the 1’s
place. So the value is 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1, which is 23 in decimal.

To get the digits of a decimal number, we can use repeated division. For
example, if we divide 456 by 10, we get 45 with remainder 6. The remainder
| is the rightmost | digit of | 456. |     |     |     |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
If we divide the result again, we get 4 with remainder 5. The remainder is the
second rightmost digit of 456. And if we divide again, we get 0 with remainder
4. The remainder is the third rightmost digit of 456, and the result, 0, tells us
| that we’re done. |     |     |     |     |     |

We can do the same thing in binary if we divide by 2. When you divide by
2, the remainder is the right-most digit, either 0 or 1. If you divide the result
again, you get the second rightmost digit. If you keep going, and write down
| the remainders, |        | you’ll       | have | your | number | in  | binary: |     |     |     |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------ | ---- | ---- | ------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 23              | / 2 is | 11 remainder |      |      | 1      |     |         |     |     |     |
| 11              | / 2 is | 5 remainder  |      |      | 1      |     |         |     |     |     |
| 5               | / 2 is | 2 remainder  |      |      | 1      |     |         |     |     |     |
| 2               | / 2 is | 1 remainder  |      |      | 0      |     |         |     |     |     |
| 1               | / 2 is | 0 remainder  |      |      | 1      |     |         |     |     |     |
Reading these remainders from bottom to top, 23 in binary is 10111.

Now, to display a number in binary, we can combine the algorithm from the
| previous | section | and | the | “count | up” pattern |     | from | Section | ??. |     |
| -------- | ------- | --- | --- | ------ | ----------- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- |
Here is a recursive method that displays any positive integer in binary:
| public | static    |                        | void | displayBinary(int |     |       | value) |     | {   |     |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- | ----- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
|        | if (value |                        | > 0) | {                 |     |       |        |     |     |     |
|        |           | displayBinary(value    |      |                   | /   | 2);   |        |     |     |     |
|        |           | System.out.print(value |      |                   |     | % 2); |        |     |     |     |
}
}
If value is 0, displayBinary does nothing (that’s the base case). If the
argument is positive, the method divides it by 2 and calls displayBinary
recursively. When the recursive call returns, the method displays one digit of
| the result | and | returns | (again). |     | Figure | illustrates |     | this | process. |     |

Theleftmostdigitisnearthebottomofthestack,soitgetsdisplayedfirst. The
rightmost digit, near the top of the stack, gets displayed last. After invoking
| displayBinary,     |     | we  | use | println | to complete |     | the      | output: |     |     |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | --- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| displayBinary(23); |     |     |     |         | // output   |     | is 10111 |         |     |     |
System.out.println();

In the past several chapters, you’ve seen methods, conditions, loops, strings,
arrays, and recursion. A great resource for practicing all of these concepts is
https://codingbat.com/.
CodingBat is a free website of programming problems developed by Nick Par-
lante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford University. As you work on
these problems, CodingBat saves your progress (if you create an account).
To conclude this chapter, we consider two problems in the Recursion-1 section
of CodingBat. One of them deals with strings, and the other deals with arrays.
Both of them have the same recursive idea: check the base case, look at the
| current | index, and | recursively | handle | the rest. |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- |
The first problem is available at https://codingbat.com/prob/p118230:
|     | Recursion-1 | noX |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Given a string, compute recursively a new string where all the 'x'
|     | chars have  | been removed. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | noX("xaxb") | → "ab"        |     |     |     |     |
|     | noX("abc")  | → "abc"       |     |     |     |     |
|     | noX("xx")   | → ""          |     |     |     |     |

| 8.8 CodingBat | Problems |     |     |     | 139 |
| ------------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
When solving recursive problems, it helps to think about the base case first.
The base case is the easiest version of the problem; for noX, it’s the empty
string. If the argument is an empty string, there are no x’s to be removed:
| if (str.length() | ==  | 0) { |     |     |     |
| ---------------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| return           | ""; |      |     |     |     |
}
Next comes the more difficult part. To solve a problem recursively, you need
to think of a simpler instance of the same problem. For noX, it’s removing all
| the x’s from | a shorter string. |     |     |     |     |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
So let’s split the string into two parts, the first letter and the rest:
| char       | first = str.charAt(0);   |                |              |       |     |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ----- | --- |
| String     | rest = str.substring(1); |                |              |       |     |
| Now we can | make a recursive         | call to remove | the x’s from | rest: |     |
| String     | recurse = noX(rest);     |                |              |       |     |
If first happens to be an x, we’re done; we just have to return recurse. Oth-
erwise, we have to concatenate first and recurse. Here’s the if statement
we need:
| if (first | == 'x') {        |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| return    | recurse;         |     |     |     |     |
| } else    | {                |     |     |     |     |
| return    | first + recurse; |     |     |     |     |
}
You can run this solution on CodingBat by pasting these snippets into the
| provided | method definition. |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The second problem is available at https://codingbat.com/prob/p135988:
Recursion-1 array11
Given an array of ints, compute recursively the number of times
| that         | the value 11 appears | in the array. |     |     |     |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| array11([1,  | 2, 11],              | 0) → 1        |     |     |     |
| array11([11, | 11],                 | 0) → 2        |     |     |     |
| array11([1,  | 2, 3,                | 4], 0) → 0    |     |     |     |

| 140 |     |     | Chapter | 8 Recursive | Methods |
| --- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
This problem uses the convention of passing the index as an argument. So the
base case is when we’ve reached the end of the array. At that point, we know
| there are | no more 11s:    |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| if (index | >= nums.length) |     | {   |     |     |
|           | return 0;       |     |     |     |     |
}
Next we look at the current number (based on the given index), and check if
it’s an 11. After that, we can recursively check the rest of the array. Similar
| to the noX      | problem,                | we look at | only one integer | per method | call: |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| int             | recurse = array11(nums, |            | index +          | 1);        |       |
| if (nums[index] |                         | == 11)     | {                |            |       |
|                 | return recurse          | + 1;       |                  |            |       |
| } else          | {                       |            |                  |            |       |
|                 | return recurse;         |            |                  |            |       |
}
Again, you can run this solutions on CodingBat by pasting the snippets into
| the method | definition. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To see how these solutions actually work, you might find it helpful to step
through them with a debugger (see Appendix ??) or Java Tutor (https://
thinkjava.org/javatutor). Then try solving other CodingBat problems on
your own.
Learning to think recursively is an important part of learning to think like a
computer scientist. Many algorithms can be written concisely with recursive
methods that perform computations on the way down, on the way up, or both.

it into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple
methods. Consider the first verse of the song “99 Bottles of Beer”:

Subsequent verses are identical except that the number of bottles gets smaller

| And | then | the | song (finally) | ends. |     |         |             |         |
Write a program that displays the entire lyrics of “99 Bottles of Beer”. Your
program should include a recursive method that does the hard part, but you
mightwanttowriteadditionalmethodstoseparateotherpartsoftheprogram.
As you develop your code, test it with a small number of verses, like 3.
Exercise 8.2 Write a recursive method named oddSum that takes a positive
odd integer n and returns the sum of odd integers from 1 to n. Start with
a base case, and use temporary variables to debug your solution. You might
find it helpful to print the value of n each time oddSum is invoked.
Exercise 8.3 In this exercise, you will use a stack diagram to understand
| the | execution                  |        | of the following | recursive     |     | method: |     |     |

Exercise 8.4 The goal of this exercise is to translate a recursive definition
into a Java method. The Ackermann function is defined for non-negative

Test your implementation of Ackermann by invoking it from main and display-
ing the return value. Note the return value gets very big very quickly. You
should try it only for small values of m and n (not bigger than 3).

| and      | an integer | n and | returns | xn.       |        |        |       |      |       |          |     |
A recursive definition of this operation is xn x·xn−1. Also, remember
| Hint: |          |        |     |            |       |       | =   |     |     |     |     |

also be written recursively. It is not common, but it is a useful exercise.
1. Write a method called maxInRange that takes an array of integers and
two indexes, lowIndex and highIndex, and finds the maximum value
in the array, but considering only the elements between lowIndex and
|     | highIndex, |     | including | both. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | --- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
This method should be recursive. If the length of the range is 1 (i.e., if
lowIndex == highIndex), we know immediately that the sole element
|     | in the | range | must | be the | maximum. | So  | that’s | the base | case. |     |     |

2. Methods like maxInRange can be awkward to use. To find the largest
element in an array, we have to provide the range for the entire array:

Write a method called max that takes an array and uses maxInRange to
|     | find and | return | the | largest | element. |     |     |     |     |     |

2. Using these methods, and without using any other String methods,
write a method called printString that takes a string as a parameter
and displays the letters of the string, one on each line. It should be a
void method.
3. Again using only these methods, write a method called printBackward

4. Now write a method called reverseString that takes a string as a pa-

| Immutable |     | Objects |           |             |              |            |
| Java is   | an  |         | language, | which means | that it uses | objects to |
object-oriented
(1) represent data and (2) provide methods related to them. This way of
organizing programs is a powerful design concept, and we will introduce it
| gradually | throughout | the | remainder | of the book. |     |     |
| --------- | ---------- | --- | --------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
An object is a collection of data that provides a set of methods. For example,
Scanner, which you saw in Section 3.2, is an object that provides methods for
| parsing | input. System.out |     | and System.in | are also | objects. |     |
| ------- | ----------------- | --- | ------------- | -------- | -------- | --- |
Strings are objects, too. They contain characters and provide methods for
manipulatingcharacterdata. Otherdatatypes, likeInteger, containnumbers
and provide methods for manipulating number data. We will explore some of
| these methods | in this    | chapter. |         |     |     |     |

| 9.1           | Primitives | vs       | Objects |     |     |     |
Not everything in Java is an object: int, double, char, and boolean are
types. When you declare a variable with a primitive type, Java
primitive
reserves a small amount of memory to store its value. Figure shows how
??
| the following | values   | are stored | in memory: |     |     |     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| int           | number = | -2;        |            |     |     |     |
| char          | symbol = | '!';       |            |     |     |     |

As you learned in Section ??, an array variable stores a reference to an array.
For example, the following line declares a variable named array and creates
an array of three characters:
char[] array = {'c', 'a', 't'};

String word1 = new String("dog"); // creates a string object
String word2 = "dog"; // implicitly creates a string object
Recall from Section ?? that you need to use the equals method to compare
strings. The equals method traverses the String objects and tests whether
they contain the same characters.

| 9.2 | The null | Keyword |     |     |     |     | 149 |
| --- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To test whether two integers or other primitive types are equal, you can simply
use the == operator. But two String objects with the same characters would
not be considered equal in the == sense. The == operator, when applied to
| string | variables, | tests | only whether | they | refer to the | object. |     |

| 9.2 | The | null | Keyword |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Often when you declare an object variable, you assign it to reference an object.
But sometimes you want to declare a variable that doesn’t refer to an object,
| at least | initially. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In Java, the keyword null is a special value that means “no object”. You can
| initialize | object | and     | array variables | this | way: |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | --------------- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| String     | name   | = null; |                 |      |      |     |     |
| int[]      | combo  | = null; |                 |      |      |     |     |
The value null is represented in memory diagrams by a small box with no
| arrow, | as in | Figure ??. |     |     |     |     |     |

combo
|     | Figure | 9.4: Memory | diagram | showing | variables | that are null. |     |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------------- | --- |
If you try to use a variable that is null by invoking a method or accessing an
| element,                           | Java | throws | a NullPointerException: |     |                         |     |     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------------- | --- | ----------------------- | --- | --- |
| System.out.println(name.length()); |      |        |                         |     | // NullPointerException |     |     |
| System.out.println(combo[0]);      |      |        |                         |     | // NullPointerException |     |     |
On the other hand, it is perfectly fine to pass a null reference as an argument
to a method, or to receive one as a return value. In these situations, null is
| often | used to | represent | a special condition |     | or indicate | an error. |     |

| 9.3 | Strings | Are | Immutable |         |     |             |         |
If the Java library didn’t have a String class, we would have to use charac-
ter arrays to store and manipulate text. Operations like concatenation (+),
indexOf, and substring would be difficult and inconvenient. Fortunately,
Java does have a String class that provides these and other methods.
For example, the methods toLowerCase and toUpperCase convert uppercase
letters to lowercase, and vice versa. These methods are often a source of con-
fusion, because it sounds like they modify strings. But neither these methods
nor any others can change a string, because strings are immutable.
When you invoke toUpperCase on a string, you get a new String object as a
| result. For | example:  |                       |          |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| String      | name      | = "Alan               | Turing"; |     |     |     |     |
| String      | upperName | = name.toUpperCase(); |          |     |     |     |     |
After these statements run, upperName refers to the string "ALAN TURING".
But name still refers to "Alan Turing". A common mistake is to assume that
| toUpperCase         |      | somehow affects | the      | original | string: |            |       |
| ------------------- | ---- | --------------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- |
| String              | name | = "Alan         | Turing"; |          |         |            |       |
| name.toUpperCase(); |      |                 |          | //       | ignores | the return | value |
System.out.println(name);
The previous code displays "Alan Turing", because the value of name, which
refers to the original String object, never changes. If you want to change
| name to | be uppercase,         | then    | you need | to assign |            | the return value: |        |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| String  | name                  | = "Alan | Turing"; |           |            |                   |        |
| name    | = name.toUpperCase(); |         |          | //        | references | the new           | string |
System.out.println(name);
A similar method is replace, which finds and replaces instances of one string
within another. This example replaces "Computer Science" with "CS":
| String | text                     | = "Computer | Science |           | is fun!"; |        |     |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ----------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | --- |
| text   | = text.replace("Computer |             |         | Science", |           | "CS"); |     |
As with toUpperCase, assigning the return value (to text) is important. If
you don’t assign the return value, invoking text.replace has no effect.

| 9.4 | Wrapper | Classes |     |     |     |     | 151 |

Strings are immutable by design, because it simplifies passing them as param-
eters and return values. And since the contents of a string can never change,
twovariablescanreferencethesamestringwithoutoneaccidentallycorrupting
the other.
| 9.4 | Wrapper |     | Classes |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Primitive types like int, double, and char cannot be null, and they do not
provide methods. For example, you can’t invoke equals on an int:
| int                              | i = 5;   |           |             |      |               |               |        |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| System.out.println(i.equals(5)); |          |           |             |      | // compiler   | error         |        |
| But                              | for each | primitive | type, there | is a | corresponding |               | in the |
|                                  |          |           |             |      |               | wrapper class |        |
Java library. The wrapper class for int is named Integer, with a capital I:
| Integer                          | i   | = Integer.valueOf(5); |     |     |             |      |     |
| -------------------------------- | --- | --------------------- | --- | --- | ----------- | ---- | --- |
| System.out.println(i.equals(5)); |     |                       |     |     | // displays | true |     |
Other wrapper classes include Boolean, Character, Double, and Long. They
are in the java.lang package, so you can use them without importing them.
Like strings, objects from wrapper classes are immutable, and you have to use
| the     | equals method         |                         | to compare | them: |              |           |     |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------ | --------- | --- |
| Integer | x                     | = Integer.valueOf(123); |            |       |              |           |     |
| Integer | y                     | = Integer.valueOf(123); |            |       |              |           |     |
| if      | (x ==                 | y) {                    |            |       | // false     |           |     |
|         | System.out.println("x |                         |            | and y | are the same | object"); |     |
}
| if  | (x.equals(y))         |     | {   |       | // true       |          |     |
| --- | --------------------- | --- | --- | ----- | ------------- | -------- | --- |
|     | System.out.println("x |     |     | and y | have the same | value"); |     |
}
Because x and y refer to different objects, this code displays only “x and y
| have | the same | value”. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Each wrapper class defines the constants MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE. For
example, Integer.MIN_VALUE is -2147483648, and Integer.MAX_VALUE is

| 152 |     |     |     | Chapter | 9 Immutable | Objects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
2147483647. Because these constants are available in wrapper classes, you
don’t have to remember them, and you don’t have to write them yourself.
Wrapper classes also provide methods for converting strings to and from prim-
itive types. For example, Integer.parseInt converts a string to an int. In
| this context, | parse                        | means “read | and translate”. |     |     |     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| String        | str = "12345";               |             |                 |     |     |     |
| int           | num = Integer.parseInt(str); |             |                 |     |     |     |
Other wrapper classes provide similar methods, like Double.parseDouble and
Boolean.parseBoolean. They also provide toString, which returns a string
| representation | of a value:                  |        |          |     |     |     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------ | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| int            | num = 12345;                 |        |          |     |     |     |
| String         | str = Integer.toString(num); |        |          |     |     |     |
| The result     | is the String                | object | "12345". |     |     |     |
It’s always possible to convert a primitive value to a string, but not the other
way around. For example, say we try to parse an invalid string like this:
| String | str = "five";                |     |     |                          |     |     |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | --- | --- | ------------------------ | --- | --- |
| int    | num = Integer.parseInt(str); |     |     | // NumberFormatException |     |     |
parseInt throws a NumberFormatException, because the characters in the
| string "five" | are not      | digits. |           |     |     |     |

Now that you know about strings, arrays, and wrapper classes, we can
finally
explain the args parameter of the main method, which we have been ignoring
since Chapter 1. If you are unfamiliar with the command-line interface, please
| read Appendix | ??. |     |     |     |     |     |

Let’s write a program to find the maximum value in a sequence of numbers.
Rather than read the numbers from System.in by using a Scanner, we’ll pass
| them as | command-line | arguments. | Here | is a starting | point: |     |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ------ | --- |

| 9.5    | Command-Line |                   | Arguments |               |         |     | 153 |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| import |              | java.util.Arrays; |           |               |         |     |     |
| public |              | class Max         | {         |               |         |     |     |
|        | public       | static            | void      | main(String[] | args) { |     |     |
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(args));
}
}
| You  | can run | this program | from | the command | line by typing | this: |     |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ----- | --- |
| java | Max     |              |      |             |                |       |     |
Theoutputindicatesthatargsisanempty array; thatis, ithasnoelements:
[]
If you provide additional values on the command line, they are passed as
arguments to main. For example, say you run the program like this:
| java | Max    | 10 -3    | 55 0 14 |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The  | output | is shown | here:   |     |     |     |     |
| [10, | -3,    | 55, 0,   | 14]     |     |     |     |     |
It’s not clear from the output, but the elements of args are strings. So args is
the array {"10", "-3", "55", "0", "14"}. To find the maximum number,
| we have | to  | convert the | arguments | to integers. |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
The following code uses an enhanced for loop (see Section ??) to parse the
| arguments |         | and find             | the largest              | value: |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| int       | max     | = Integer.MIN_VALUE; |                          |        |     |     |     |
| for       | (String | arg                  | : args)                  | {      |     |     |     |
|           | int     | value                | = Integer.parseInt(arg); |        |     |     |     |
|           | if      | (value               | > max)                   | {      |     |     |     |
|           |         | max =                | value;                   |        |     |     |     |
}
}
| System.out.println("The |     |     |     | max is | " + max); |     |     |
| ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- |
We begin by initializing max to the smallest (most negative) number an int
can represent. That way, the first value we parse will replace max. As we find
| larger | values, | they will | replace | max as well. |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |

| 154 |     |     |     |     | Chapter | 9 Immutable | Objects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
If args is empty, the result will be MIN_VALUE. We can prevent this situation
from happening by checking args at the beginning of the program:
| if  | (args.length               |     |     | == 0) { |          |              |     |
| --- | -------------------------- | --- | --- | ------- | -------- | ------------ | --- |
|     | System.err.println("Usage: |     |     |         | java Max | <numbers>"); |     |
return;
}
It’s customary for programs that require command-line arguments to display a
“usage” message if the arguments are not valid. For example, if you run javac
or java from the command line without any arguments, you will get a very
long message.
| 9.6 | Argument |     |     | Validation |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
As we discussed in Section 5.9, you should never assume that program input
will be in the correct format. Sometimes users make mistakes, such as pressing
| the | wrong | key or | misreading | instructions. |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
Or even worse, someone might make intentional “mistakes” to see what your
program will do. One way hackers break into computer systems is by entering
| malicious | input |     | that | causes a program | to fail. |     |     |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---------------- | -------- | --- | --- |
Programmers can make mistakes too. It’s difficult to write bug-free software,
| especially |     | when | working | in teams | on large projects. |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
For all of these reasons, it’s good practice to validate arguments passed to
methods, including the main method. In the previous section, we did this by
| ensuring | that | args.length |     | was not | 0.  |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
As a further example, consider a method that checks whether the first word
of a sentence is capitalized. We can write this method using the Character
| wrapper | class: |        |                                       |                      |     |        |     |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --- | ------ | --- |
| public  |        | static | boolean                               | isCapitalized(String |     | str) { |     |
|         | return |        | Character.isUpperCase(str.charAt(0)); |                      |     |        |     |
}
The expression str.charAt(0) makes two assumptions: the string object ref-
erenced by str exists, and it has at least one character. What if these as-
| sumptions |     | don’t | hold | at run-time? |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | ----- | ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |

• If str is null, invoking charAt will cause a NullPointerException,
|     | because |     | you can’t | invoke | a   | method | on null. |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --- | --------- | ------ | --- | ------ | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
• Ifstrreferstoanemptystring, whichisaStringobjectwithnocharac-
ters, charAt will cause a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, because
|     | there | is  | no character | at  | index | 0.  |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | --- | ------------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
We can prevent these exceptions by validating str of the method.
|     |               |         |           |         |                      |     |     |         | at the start |     |
| --- | ------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------- | --- | --- | ------- | ------------ | --- |
| If  | it’s invalid, |         | we return | before  | executing            |     | the | rest of | the method:  |     |
|     | public        | static  |           | boolean | isCapitalized(String |     |     |         | str) {       |     |
|     |               | if (str | ==        | null || | str.isEmpty())       |     |     | {       |              |     |
|     |               | return  |           | false;  |                      |     |     |         |              |     |
}
|     |     | return | Character.isUpperCase(str.charAt(0)); |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------ | ------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
Notice that null and empty are different concepts, as shown in Figure ??.
The variable str1 is null, meaning that it doesn’t reference an object. The
| variable |     | str2 | refers | to the empty |     | string, | an object |     | that exists. |     |

| --- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ------- | --- | ------- | --- | ------------- | --- |
|     |     | Figure | 9.5: | Memory | diagram |     | of null | and | empty string. |     |
Beginners sometimes make the mistake of checking for empty first. Doing
so causes a NullPointerException, because you can’t invoke methods on
| variables |                   | that | are null: |     |     |          |     |     |        |     |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---- | --------- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | ------ | --- |
|           | if (str.isEmpty() |      |           | ||  | str | == null) | {   | //  | wrong! |     |
Checking for null first prevents the NullPointerException. If str is null,
the || operator will short circuit (see Section 5.5) and evaluate to true im-
| mediately. |     | As  | a result, | str.isEmpty() |     |     | will not | be  | called. |     |

| 9.7 | BigInteger | Arithmetic |     |         |             |         |
It might not be clear at this point why you would ever need an integer object
whenyoucanjustuseanintorlong. Oneadvantageisthevarietyofmethods
that Integer and Long provide. But there is another reason: when you need
| very large | integers | that exceed | Long.MAX_VALUE. |     |     |     |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
BigInteger is a Java class that can represent arbitrarily large integers. There
is no upper bound except the limitations of memory size and processing speed.
Take a minute to read the documentation, which you can find by doing a web
| search | for “Java BigInteger”. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To use BigIntegers, you have to import java.math.BigInteger at the begin-
ning of your program. There are several ways to create a BigInteger, but the
simplest uses valueOf. The following code converts a long to a BigInteger:
| long       | x = 17; |                          |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BigInteger | big     | = BigInteger.valueOf(x); |     |     |     |     |
You can also create BigIntegers from strings. For example, here is a 20-digit
| integer    | that is too                 | big to store | using          | a long: |     |     |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| String     | s = "12345678901234567890"; |              |                |         |     |     |
| BigInteger | bigger                      | = new        | BigInteger(s); |         |     |     |
Noticethedifferenceintheprevioustwoexamples: youusevalueOftoconvert
| integers, | and new BigInteger |     | to  | convert strings. |     |     |
| --------- | ------------------ | --- | --- | ---------------- | --- | --- |
SinceBigIntegersarenotprimitivetypes,theusualmathoperatorsdon’twork.
Instead, we have to use methods like add. To add two BigIntegers, we invoke
| add on     | one and pass | the other                       | as  | an argument: |     |     |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- |
| BigInteger | a =          | BigInteger.valueOf(17);         |     |              |     |     |
| BigInteger | b =          | BigInteger.valueOf(1700000000); |     |              |     |     |
| BigInteger | c =          | a.add(b);                       |     |              |     |     |
Like strings, BigInteger objects are immutable. Methods like add, multiply,
and pow all return new BigIntegers, rather than modify an existing one.
Internally, a BigInteger is implemented using an array of ints, similar to the
way a string is implemented using an array of chars. Each int in the array

| 9.8 Incremental |     |     | Design |     | 157 |
| --------------- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- |
stores a portion of the BigInteger. The methods of BigInteger traverse this
| array to | perform | addition, | multiplication, | etc. |     |
| -------- | ------- | --------- | --------------- | ---- | --- |
For very long floating-point values, take a look at java.math.BigDecimal.
Interestingly, BigDecimal objects represent floating-point numbers internally
| by using        | a BigInteger! |     |        |     |     |

| 9.8 Incremental |               |     | Design |     |     |
One challenge of programming, especially for beginners, is figuring out how to
divide a program into methods. In this section, we present a design process
that allows you to divide a program into methods as you go along. The process
is called “encapsulation and generalization”. The essential steps are as follows:
1. Write a few lines of code in main or another method, and test them.
2. When they are working, wrap them in a new method and test again.
3. If it’s appropriate, replace literal values with variables and parameters.
To demonstrate this process, we’ll develop methods that display multiplication
tables. We begin by writing and testing a few lines of code. Here is a loop
| that displays            |     | the multiples | of two,      | all on one line: |     |
| ------------------------ | --- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --- |
| for (int                 |     | i = 1;        | i <= 6; i++) | {                |     |
| System.out.printf("%4d", |     |               |              | 2 * i);          |     |
}
System.out.println();
Each time through the loop, we display the value of 2 * i, padded with spaces
so it’s four characters wide. Since we use System.out.printf, the output
| appears | on a | single line. |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
Aftertheloop,wecallprintlntoprintanewlinecharacter. Rememberthatin
some environments, none of the output is displayed until the line is complete.
| The output | of  | the code | so far is shown | here: |     |
| ---------- | --- | -------- | --------------- | ----- | --- |
| 2          | 4   | 6        | 8 10 12         |       |     |

| 158 |     |     |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 9 Immutable | Objects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ----------- | ------- |
The next step is to encapsulate the code; that is, we “wrap” the code in a
method:
| public |     | static                   | void | printRow() |       | {    |         |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ------------------------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- |
|        | for | (int                     | i =  | 1; i       | <= 6; | i++) | {       |     |     |
|        |     | System.out.printf("%4d", |      |            |       |      | 2 * i); |     |     |
}
System.out.println();
}
Finally, we the method to print multiples of other numbers by
generalize
replacing the constant value 2 with a parameter n. This step is called “gener-
alization”, because it makes the method more general (less specific):
| public |     | static                   | void | printRow(int |       |      | n) {    |                |     |
| ------ | --- | ------------------------ | ---- | ------------ | ----- | ---- | ------- | -------------- | --- |
|        | for | (int                     | i =  | 1; i         | <= 6; | i++) | {       |                |     |
|        |     | System.out.printf("%4d", |      |              |       |      | n * i); | // generalized | n   |
}
System.out.println();
}
Invoking this method with the argument 2 yields the same output as before.
| With | the | argument | 3,   | the output |     | is as follows: |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|      | 3   | 6        | 9 12 | 15         | 18  |                |     |     |     |
By now, you can probably guess how we are going to display a multiplication
table: we’ll invoke printRow repeatedly with different arguments. In fact,
| we’ll | use another |     | loop   | to iterate | through | the | rows: |     |     |
| ----- | ----------- | --- | ------ | ---------- | ------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| for   | (int        | i   | = 1; i | <= 6;      | i++)    | {   |       |     |     |
printRow(i);
}
| And | the output |       | looks like | this: |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | 1          | 2     | 3 4        | 5     | 6   |     |     |     |     |
|     | 2          | 4     | 6 8        | 10    | 12  |     |     |     |     |
|     | 3          | 6     | 9 12       | 15    | 18  |     |     |     |     |
|     | 4          | 8 12  | 16         | 20    | 24  |     |     |     |     |
|     | 5          | 10 15 | 20         | 25    | 30  |     |     |     |     |

The previous result is similar to the “nested loops” approach in Section ??.
However, the inner loop is now encapsulated in the printRow method. We can
| encapsulate |     | the    | outer | loop in a method | too:   |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ----- | ---------------- | ------ | --- | --- |
| public      |     | static | void  | printTable()     | {      |     |     |
|             | for | (int   | i =   | 1; i <= 6;       | i++) { |     |     |
printRow(i);
}
}
The initial version of printTable always displays six rows. We can generalize
| it by  | replacing |        | the literal | 6 with a parameter: |        |                |      |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------- | ------ | -------------- | ---- |
| public |           | static | void        | printTable(int      | rows)  | {              |      |
|        | for       | (int   | i =         | 1; i <= rows;       | i++) { | // generalized | rows |
printRow(i);
}
}
| Here | is the | output | of printTable(7): |       |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ----------------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
|      | 1      | 2      | 3 4               | 5 6   |     |     |     |
|      | 2      | 4      | 6 8               | 10 12 |     |     |     |
|      | 3      | 6      | 9 12              | 15 18 |     |     |     |
|      | 4      | 8      | 12 16             | 20 24 |     |     |     |
|      | 5      | 10     | 15 20             | 25 30 |     |     |     |
|      | 6      | 12     | 18 24             | 30 36 |     |     |     |
|      | 7      | 14     | 21 28             | 35 42 |     |     |     |
That’s better, but it always displays the same number of columns. We can
| generalize |     | more                     | by adding | a parameter   | to printRow: |                |      |
| ---------- | --- | ------------------------ | --------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---- |
| public     |     | static                   | void      | printRow(int  | n, int       | cols) {        |      |
|            | for | (int                     | i =       | 1; i <= cols; | i++) {       | // generalized | cols |
|            |     | System.out.printf("%4d", |           |               | n * i);      |                |      |
}
System.out.println();
}

Now printRow takes two parameters: n is the value whose multiples should be
displayed, and cols is the number of columns. Since we added a parameter to
printRow, we also have to change the line in printTable where it is invoked:
|     | public | static      |     | void | printTable(int |       |      | rows) { |     |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | --- | ---- | -------------- | ----- | ---- | ------- | --- |
|     | for    | (int        | i   | = 1; | i <=           | rows; | i++) | {       |     |
|     |        | printRow(i, |     |      | rows);         |       |      |         |     |
}
}
When this line executes, it evaluates rows and passes the value, which is 7 in
this example, as an argument. In printRow, this value is assigned to cols. As
a result, the number of columns equals the number of rows, so we get a square
| 7 x | 7 table, | instead |     | of the | previous | 7   | x 6 table. |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ------- | --- | ------ | -------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- |
When you generalize a method appropriately, you often find that it has capa-
bilitiesyoudidnotplan. Forexample, youmightnoticethatthemultiplication
table is symmetric. Since ab = ba, all the entries in the table appear twice.
You could save ink by printing half of the table, and you would have to change
| only | one         | line | of printTable: |     |       |       |      |            |     |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | -------------- | --- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---------- | --- |
|      | printRow(i, |      | i);            | //  | using | i for | both | n and cols |     |
This means the length of each row is the same as its row number. The result
| is a | triangular |     | multiplication |     | table: |     |     |     |     |

Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused, and some-

the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.
Exercise 9.1 The point of this exercise is to explore Java types and fill in
| some of the | details that | aren’t | covered in | the chapter. |     |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------ | --- |
1. Create a new program named Test.java and write a main method that
contains expressions that combine various types using the + operator.
For example, what happens when you “add” a String and a char? Does
it perform character addition or string concatenation? What is the type
| of the | result? |     |     |     |     |

2. Makeabiggercopyofthefollowingtableandfillitin. Attheintersection
of each pair of types, you should indicate whether it is legal to use the +
operator with these types, the operation that is performed (addition or
|     | concatenation), |     | and | the type | of   | the result. |        |        |

3. Think about some of the choices the designers of Java made, based on
this table. How many of the entries seem unavoidable, as if there was no
other choice? How many seem like arbitrary choices from several equally
|     | reasonable |     | possibilities? | Which |     | entries seem | most problematic? |     |
| --- | ---------- | --- | -------------- | ----- | --- | ------------ | ----------------- | --- |
4. Here’s a puzzler: normally, the statement x++ is exactly equivalent to
x = x + 1. But if x is a char, it’s not exactly the same! In that case,
x++ is legal, but x = x + 1 causes an error. Try it out. See what the
error message is, and then see if you can figure out what is going on.
5. What happens when you add "" (the empty string) to the other types;
|          | for | example, | ""            | + 5?    |        |           |        |                   |

2. Display a table of the integers from 0 to 30 along with their factorials.

sends to myexp) and see the effect on the accuracy of the result. Adjust
this value until the estimated value agrees with the correct answer when

| Mutable |     | Objects |     |     |     |     |
As you learned in the previous chapter, an object is a collection of data that
provides a set of methods. For example, a String is a collection of characters
| that provides |     | methods like | charAt | and | substring. |     |
| ------------- | --- | ------------ | ------ | --- | ---------- | --- |
This chapter explores two new types of objects: Point and Rectangle. You’ll
see how to write methods that take objects as parameters and produce objects
as return values. You will also look at the source code for the Java library.
| 10.1 | Point | Objects |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In math, 2D points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating
the coordinates. For example, indicates the origin, and indicates
(0,0) (x,y)
| the point | x units | to the | right and | y   | units | up from the origin. |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | --------- | --- | ----- | ------------------- |
Thejava.awtpackageprovidesaclassnamedPointthatrepresentsalocation
in a Cartesian plane. In order to use the Point class, you have to import it:
| import | java.awt.Point; |              |     |     |     |               |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | ------------- |
| Then,  | to create       | a new point, | you | use | the | new operator: |
| Point  | blank;          |              |     |     |     |               |
| blank  | =               | new Point(3, | 4); |     |     |               |

The first line declares that blank has type Point. The second line creates
the new Point with the coordinates x = 3 and y = 4. The result of the new
| operator | is a reference | to the object. | Figure |     | ?? shows the | result. |     |

Figure10.1: MemorydiagramshowingavariablethatreferstoaPointobject.
As usual, the name of the variable blank appears outside the box, and its
value appears inside the box. In this case, the value is a reference, which
is represented with an arrow. The arrow points to the Point object, which
| contains | two variables, | x and y. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Variables that belong to an object are called attributes. In some documen-
tation, you also see them called “fields”. To access an attribute of an object,
| Java uses | dot notation. | For example: |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| int       | x = blank.x;  |              |     |     |     |     |     |
The expression blank.x means “go to the object blank refers to, and get the
value of the attribute x.” In this case, we assign that value to a local variable
named x.
There is no conflict between the local variable x and the attribute x. The
purpose of dot notation is to identify variable you are referring to un-
which
ambiguously.
| You can                    | use dot notation | as part   | of an | expression. | For        | example: |     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | --- |
| System.out.println(blank.x |                  |           | + ",  | " +         | blank.y);  |          |     |
| int                        | sum = blank.x    | * blank.x | +     | blank.y     | * blank.y; |          |     |
The first line displays 3, 4. The second line calculates the value 25.

| 10.2 | Objects |         | as Parameters |     |            |     |     |     |     |     | 169 |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10.2 |         | Objects |               | as  | Parameters |     |     |     |     |     |     |
You can pass objects as parameters in the usual way. For example:
| public |                        | static | void | printPoint(Point |     |       |     | p) { |       |         |     |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------ | ---- | ---------------- | --- | ----- | --- | ---- | ----- | ------- | --- |
|        | System.out.println("(" |        |      |                  |     | + p.x | +   | ", " | + p.y | + ")"); |     |
}
This method takes a point as an argument and displays its attributes in paren-
| theses. | If  | you invoke |     | printPoint(blank), |     |     | it  | displays | (3, | 4). |     |
| ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
As another example, we can rewrite the distance method from Section 4.9 so
| that   | it takes | two    | Points       | as      | parameters     |      | instead | of   | four doubles: |       |     |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------------ | ------- | -------------- | ---- | ------- | ---- | ------------- | ----- | --- |
| public |          | static | double       |         | distance(Point |      |         | p1,  | Point         | p2) { |     |
|        | int      | dx     | = p2.x       | - p1.x; |                |      |         |      |               |       |     |
|        | int      | dy     | = p2.y       | - p1.y; |                |      |         |      |               |       |     |
|        | return   |        | Math.sqrt(dx |         | *              | dx + | dy *    | dy); |               |       |     |
}
Passing objects as parameters makes the source code more readable and less
| error-prone |     | because | related |     | values | are bundled |     | together. |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ------- | ------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
You actually don’t need to write a distance method, because Point objects
already have one. To compute the distance between two points, we invoke
| distance |     | on one | and                | pass the | other | as  | an argument: |      |        |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ------ | ------------------ | -------- | ----- | --- | ------------ | ---- | ------ | --- | --- |
| Point    |     | p1 =   | new Point(0,       |          | 0);   |     |              |      |        |     |     |
| Point    |     | p2 =   | new Point(3,       |          | 4);   |     |              |      |        |     |     |
| double   |     | dist   | = p1.distance(p2); |          |       |     | //           | dist | is 5.0 |     |     |
It turns out you don’t need the printPoint method either. If you invoke
System.out.println(blank), it prints the type of the object and the values
of the attributes:
java.awt.Point[x=3,y=4]
Point objects provide a method called toString that returns a string repre-
sentation of a point. When you call println with objects, it automatically
| calls | toString | and | displays |     | the result. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

The java.awt package also provides a class named Rectangle. To use it, you
| have   | to import | it:                 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| import |           | java.awt.Rectangle; |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
Rectangle objects are similar to points, but they have four attributes: x, y,
width, and height. The following example creates a Rectangle object and
| makes     | the variable |     | box    | refer to     | it:         |     |      |       |     |     |
| --------- | ------------ | --- | ------ | ------------ | ----------- | --- | ---- | ----- | --- | --- |
| Rectangle |              | box | = new  | Rectangle(0, |             | 0,  | 100, | 200); |     |     |

| If you | run System.out.println(box), |       |        |     |         | you     | get this: |             |         |     |
java.awt.Rectangle[x=0,y=0,width=100,height=200]
Again, println uses the toString method provided by Rectangle, which
| knows | how | to represent |     | Rectangle |     | objects | as strings. |     |     |     |

Youcanalsowritemethodsthatreturnnewobjects. Forexample, findCenter
takes a Rectangle as an argument and returns a Point with the coordinates
| of the | center | of the | rectangle: |                      |     |      |     |      |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | -------------------- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| public |        | static | Point      | findCenter(Rectangle |     |      |     | box) | {   |     |
|        | int    | x =    | box.x      | + box.width          |     | / 2; |     |      |     |     |
|        | int    | y =    | box.y      | + box.height         |     | / 2; |     |      |     |     |

}
The return type of this method is Point. The last line creates a new Point
| object | and | returns | a reference |     | to it. |     |     |     |     |     |

You can change the contents of an object by making an assignment to one of
its attributes. For example, to “move” a rectangle without changing its size,
| you can    | modify | the      | x and  | y values:    |     |     |               |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------ | ------------ | --- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- |
| Rectangle  |        | box      | = new  | Rectangle(0, |     |     | 0, 100, 200); |     |     |
| box.x      | =      | box.x    | + 50;  |              |     |     |               |     |     |
| box.y      | =      | box.y    | + 100; |              |     |     |               |     |     |

We can encapsulate this code in a method and generalize it to move the rect-
| angle  | by any | amount: |       |                    |     |     |      |                 |     |

| public |        | static  | void  | moveRect(Rectangle |     |     | box, | int dx, int dy) | {   |
|        | box.x  | =       | box.x | + dx;              |     |     |      |                 |     |
|        | box.y  | =       | box.y | + dy;              |     |     |      |                 |     |
}
The variables dx and dy indicate how far to move the rectangle in each direc-
tion. Invoking this method has the effect of modifying the Rectangle that is
| passed        | as an | argument: |       |              |     |     |               |           |     |
| ------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ------------ | --- | --- | ------------- | --------- | --- |
| Rectangle     |       | box       | = new | Rectangle(0, |     |     | 0, 100, 200); |           |     |
| moveRect(box, |       |           | 50,   | 100);        | //  | now | at (50, 100,  | 100, 200) |     |
Modifying objects by passing them as arguments to methods can be useful.
But it can also make debugging difficult, because it is not always clear which
| method | invocations |     | modify | their | arguments. |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | --- | ------ | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Java provides a number of methods that operate on Points and Rectangles.
For example, translate has the same effect as moveRect, but instead of pass-
| ing the | rectangle |     | as an | argument, | you | use | dot notation: |     |     |

This syntax—using dot notation to invoke a method on an object, rather than
passing it as a parameter—is more consistent with the style of object-oriented
programming.

Remember that when you assign an object to a variable, you are assigning a
to an object. It is possible to have multiple variables that refer to
reference
the same object. For example, this code creates two variables that refer to the
same Rectangle:
| Rectangle | box1 | = new   | Rectangle(0, |     | 0, 100, | 200); |     |     |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ------------ | --- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| Rectangle | box2 | = box1; |              |     |         |       |     |     |
Figure shows the result: box1 and box2 refer to the same object, so any
??
| changes | that affect | one variable | also | affect | the other. |     |     |     |

For example, the following code uses grow to make box1 bigger by 50 units in
all directions. It decreases x and y by 50, and it increases height and width
by 100:

Now, if we print box1, we are not surprised to see that it has changed:
java.awt.Rectangle[x=-50,y=-50,width=200,height=300]
And if we print box2, we should not be surprised to see that it has changed
| too, | because | it refers | to  | the | same | object: |     |     |     |

This scenario is called “aliasing” because a single object has multiple names,
| or  | aliases, | that refer | to  | it. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
As you can tell from this simple example, code that involves aliasing can get
| confusing |     | fast, and | it      | can be | difficult | to  | debug. |     |     |

So far we have used several classes from the Java library, including System,
String, Scanner, Math, and Random. These classes are written in Java, so you
| can | read | the source | code | to  | see how | they | work. |     |     |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | ---- | --- | ------- | ---- | ----- | --- | --- |
The Java library contains thousands of files, many of which are thousands of
lines of code. That’s more than one person could read and understand fully,
| but | don’t | be intimidated! |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Because it’s so large, the library source code is stored in a ZIP archive named
src.zip. If you have Java installed on your computer, you should already have
| this | file somewhere: |        |             |        |            |                      |                    |          |     |

|      | If not,         | you    | might       | have   | to install | the                  | openjdk-...-source | package. |     |

features we haven’t discussed yet, so you probably won’t understand every

Notice how much of Point.java is documentation (see Appendix ??). Each
method includes comments and tags like @param and @return. Javadoc reads
these comments and generates documentation in HTML. You can see the same
| documentation |     | online | by doing | a web | search | for “Java | Point”. |     |     |

To summarize what you’ve learned so far, Point and Rectangle objects have
attributes and methods. Attributes are an object’s data; methods are an
object’s code. An object’s definition specifies the attributes and methods
class
that it has.

In Section 4.5, we introduced the idea that variables have scope. The scope of

| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | --- | ------------ | -------- | --- |
Attributes are created when an object is created, and they disappear when the
object is destroyed. They can be used in any of the object’s methods, using
the keyword this. And if they are public, they can be used in other classes
| via references |     | to the | object, | box1.x. |     |     |     |
| -------------- | --- | ------ | ------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
When the Java compiler encounters a variable name, it searches backward for
its declaration. The compiler first looks for local variables, then parameters,
then attributes.
| 10.9 | Garbage |     | Collection |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In the previous section, we said that attributes exist as long as the object
exists. But when does an object cease to exist? Here is a simple example:
| Point | blank   | = new | Point(3, | 4); |     |     |     |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| blank | = null; |       |          |     |     |     |     |
The first line creates a new Point object and makes blank refer to it. The
second line changes blank so that instead of referring to the object, it refers
to nothing. As shown in Figure ??, after the second assignment, there are no
| references | to the | Point | object. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
If there are no references to an object, there is no way to access its attributes
or invoke a method on it. From the program’s point of view, it ceases to exist.
However, it’s still present in the computer’s memory, taking up space.
As your program runs, the system automatically looks for stranded objects
and deletes them; then the space can be reused for new objects. This process
| is called | garbage | collection. |     |     |     |     |     |

You don’t have to do anything to make garbage collection happen, and in gen-
eral, you don’t have to be aware of it. But in high-performance applications,
you may notice a slight delay every now and then while Java reclaims space
from discarded objects.
10.10 Mutable vs Immutable
Points and Rectangles are mutable objects, because their attributes can be
modified. You can modify their attributes directly, like box.x = 15, or you
can invoke methods that modify their attributes, like box.translate(15, 0).
In contrast, immutable objects like Strings and Integers cannot be modified.
They don’t allow direct access to their attributes or provide methods that
change them.
Immutable objects have advantages that help improve the reliability and per-
formance of programs. You can pass strings (and other immutable objects)
to methods without worrying about their contents changing as a side-effect of
the method. That makes programs easier to debug and more reliable.
Also, two strings that contain the same characters can be stored in memory
only once. That can reduce the amount of memory the program uses and can
speed it up.
In the following example, s1 and s2 are created differently, but they refer to
equivalent strings; that is, the two strings contain the same characters:

| 178    |        |                        |           |               | Chapter | 10       | Mutable     | Objects |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| public |        | class Surprise         |           | {             |         |          |             |         |
|        | public | static                 | void      | main(String[] |         | args)    | {           |         |
|        |        | String                 | s1 = "Hi, | Mom!";        |         |          |             |         |
|        |        | String                 | s2 = "Hi, | " + "Mom!";   |         |          |             |         |
|        |        | if (s1                 | == s2)    | {             |         | // true! |             |         |
|        |        | System.out.println("s1 |           |               | and     | s2 are   | the same"); |         |
}
}
}
Because both strings are specified at compile time, the compiler can tell that
they are equivalent. And because strings are immutable, there is no need to
make two copies; the compiler can create one String and make both variables
| refer | to it. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
As a result, the test s1 == s2 turns out to be true, which means that s1 and
s2 refer to the same object. In other words, they are not just equivalent; they
are identical.
Although immutable objects have some advantages, mutable objects have
other advantages. Sometimes it is more efficient to modify an existing ob-
ject, rather than create a new one. And some computations can be expressed
| more    | naturally | using         | mutation. |         |        |          |           |     |

Here’s an example in which mutable objects are efficient and arguably more
natural: building a long string by concatenating lots of small pieces.
Strings are particularly inefficient for this operation. For example, consider
the following program, which reads 10 lines from System.in and concatenates
| them | into a | single String: |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| String |               | text | = ""; |                  |         |     |     |          |            |     |
| for    | (int          | i    | = 0;  | i < 10;          | i++)    | {   |     |          |            |     |
|        | String        |      | line  | = in.nextLine(); |         |     |     | //       | new string |     |
|        | text          | =    | text  | + line           | + '\n'; |     | //  | two more | strings    |     |
}
| System.out.print("You |     |     |     |     | entered:\n" |     | + text); |     |     |     |
| --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
Inside the for loop, in.nextLine() returns a new string each time it is in-
voked. The next line of code concatenates text and line, which creates
another string, and then appends the newline character, which creates yet
| another | string. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
As a result, this loop creates 30 String objects! At the end, text refers to
the most recent String. Garbage collection deletes the rest, but that’s a lot
| of garbage |     | for a | seemingly | simple |     | program. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ----- | --------- | ------ | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The Java library provides the StringBuilder class for just this reason. It’s
part of the java.lang package, so you don’t need to import it. Because
StringBuilder objects are mutable, they can implement concatenation more
efficiently.
| Here’s        | a version |     | of the | program          | that             | uses | StringBuilder: |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --------- | --- | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| StringBuilder |           |     | text   | = new            | StringBuilder(); |      |                |     |     |     |
| for           | (int      | i   | = 0;   | i < 10;          | i++)             | {    |                |     |     |     |
|               | String    |     | line   | = in.nextLine(); |                  |      |                |     |     |     |
text.append(line);
text.append('\n');
}
| System.out.print("You |     |     |     |     | entered:\n" |     | + text); |     |     |     |
| --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
The append method takes a String as a parameter and appends it to the end
oftheStringBuilder. Eachtimeitisinvoked,itmodifiestheStringBuilder;
| it doesn’t |     | create | any | new objects. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ------ | --- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
If needed, you can return the StringBuilder’s contents as a string by calling
| the    | toString | method: |     |                  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | --- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| String |          | result  | =   | text.toString(); |     |     |     |     |     |     |

The StringBuilder class also provides methods for inserting and deleting
parts of strings efficiently. Programs that manipulate large amounts of text
| run   | much | faster     | if you | use | StringBuilder |     | instead | of String. |     |     |

the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.
At this point, you know enough to read Appendix ??, which is about simple
2D graphics and animations. During the next few chapters, you should take a

2. What is the output of the program?
3. Is the blank object mutable or immutable? How can you tell?
public static int riddle(int x, Point p) {
x = x + 7;
return x + p.x + p.y;
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
int x = 5;
Point blank = new Point(1, 2);
System.out.println(riddle(x, blank));
System.out.println(x);
System.out.println(blank.x);
System.out.println(blank.y);
}
Exercise 10.2 The point of this exercise is to make sure you understand the
mechanism for returning new objects from methods. The following code uses
findCenter and distance as defined in this chapter.
1. Draw a stack diagram showing the state of the program just before
findCenter returns. Include all variables and parameters, and show
the objects those variables refer to.
2. Draw a stack diagram showing the state of the program just before
distance returns. Show all variables, parameters, and objects.
3. What is the output of this program? (Can you tell without running it?)
public static void main(String[] args) {
Point blank = new Point(5, 8);
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 2, 4, 4);
Point center = findCenter(rect);
double dist = distance(center, blank);
System.out.println(dist);

| Designing |     | Classes |     |     |     |
Whenever you create a new class, you are creating a new object type with the
same name. So way back in Section 1.3, when we created the class Hello, we
| also created | an object | type named | Hello. |     |     |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --- |
We didn’t declare any variables with type Hello, and we didn’t use new to
create Hello objects. And it wouldn’t have done much good if we had—but
| we could | have! |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In this chapter, you will learn to design classes that represent useful objects.
| Here are | the main | ideas: |     |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
• Again, defining a creates a new object type with the same name.
class
• A class definition is a template for objects: it specifies what attributes
| the | objects | have and what | methods can | operate | on them. |
| --- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- |
• Every object belongs to an object type; that is, it is an instance of a
class.
• The new operator objects; that is, it creates new instances
instantiates
| of  | a class. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Think of a class as a blueprint for a house: you can use the same blueprint to
| build any | number | of houses. |     |     |     |

| 11.1 | The | Time Class |         |              |         |
A common reason to define a new class is to encapsulate related data in an
object that can be treated as a single unit. That way, we can use objects
as parameters and return values, rather than passing and returning multiple
values. You have already seen two types that encapsulate data in this way:
| Point | and Rectangle. |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Anotherexample, whichwewillimplementourselves, isTime, whichrepresents
a time of day. The data encapsulated in a Time object includes an hour, a
minute, and a number of seconds. Because every Time object contains these
| values, | we define | attributes to | hold them. |     |     |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
Attributes are also called variables, because each instance has its
instance
own variables (as opposed to “class variables”, coming up in Section ??).
The first step is to decide what type each variable should be. It seems clear
that hour and minute should be integers. Just to keep things interesting, let’s
| make second | a double. |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Instance variables are declared at the beginning of the class definition, outside
any method. By itself, this code fragment is a legal class definition:
| public | class   | Time {         |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | private | int hour;      |     |     |     |
|        | private | int minute;    |     |     |     |
|        | private | double second; |     |     |     |
}
The Time class is public, which means that it can be used in other classes.
But the instance variables are private, which means they can be accessed
only from inside the Time class. If you try to read or write them from another
| class, you | will get | a compiler | error. |     |     |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --- |
Private instance variables help keep classes isolated from each other, so that
changes in one class won’t require changes in other classes. It also simpli-
fies what other programmers need to know to use your classes. This kind of
| isolation | is called | information | hiding. |     |     |

| ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
After declaring instance variables, the next step is to define a constructor,
which is a special method that initializes the object. The syntax for construc-
| tors is | similar to | that | of other | methods, |     | except | for the | following: |
| ------- | ---------- | ---- | -------- | -------- | --- | ------ | ------- | ---------- |
• The name of the constructor is the same as the name of the class.
| • Constructors |             | have        | no     | return      | type    | (and | no return | value). |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- | ------- | ---- | --------- | ------- |
| • The          | keyword     | static      |        | is omitted. |         |      |           |         |
| Here is        | an example  | constructor |        |             | for the | Time | class:    |         |
| public         | Time()      | {           |        |             |         |      |           |         |
|                | this.hour   | =           | 0;     |             |         |      |           |         |
|                | this.minute |             | = 0;   |             |         |      |           |         |
|                | this.second |             | = 0.0; |             |         |      |           |         |
}
Thisconstructordoesnottakeanyarguments. Eachlineinitializesaninstance
| variable | to 0 (which | is  | midnight |     | for a | Time | object). |     |
| -------- | ----------- | --- | -------- | --- | ----- | ---- | -------- | --- |
The name this is a keyword that refers to the object we are creating. You can
use this the same way you use the name of any other object. For example,
you can read and write the instance variables of this, and you can pass this
as an argument to other methods. But you do not declare this, and you can’t
| make an | assignment |     | to it. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A common error when writing constructors is to put a return statement at
| the end.  | Like void | methods, |               | constructors |     | do      | not return | values. |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------ | --- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| To create | a Time    | object,  | you           | must         | use | the new | operator:  |         |
| public    | static    | void     | main(String[] |              |     | args)   | {          |         |
|           | Time time | =        | new           | Time();      |     |         |            |         |
}
When you use new, Java creates the object and invokes your constructor to
initialize the instance variables. When the constructor is done, new returns a

reference to the new object. In this example, the reference gets assigned to
the variable time, which has type Time. Figure ?? shows the result.
Beginners sometimes make the mistake of using new in the constructor:
| public | Time()      | {    |                       |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | new Time(); |      | // StackOverflowError |     |     |     |
|        | this.hour   | = 0; |                       |     |     |     |
|        | this.minute | =    | 0;                    |     |     |     |
|        | this.second | =    | 0.0;                  |     |     |     |
}
Doing so causes an infinite recursion, since new invokes the constructor,
same
which uses new again, which invokes the constructor again, and so on.
| 11.3 | Value | Constructors |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ----- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Like other methods, constructors can be overloaded, which means you can
provide multiple constructors with different parameters. Java knows which
constructor to invoke by matching the arguments you provide with the pa-
| rameters | of the constructor. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
It is common to provide both a “default constructor” that takes no arguments,
| like the | previous | one, and | a “value constructor”, |     | like this one: |     |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------- | --- | -------------- | --- |

| 11.3   | Value       | Constructors |           |             |        |           | 187 |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- | ------ | --------- | --- |
| public |             | Time(int     | hour,     | int minute, | double | second) { |     |
|        | this.hour   |              | = hour;   |             |        |           |     |
|        | this.minute |              | = minute; |             |        |           |     |
|        | this.second |              | = second; |             |        |           |     |
}
To invoke this constructor, you have to provide arguments to the new operator.
The following example creates a Time object that represents a fraction of a
| second | before | noon: |          |     |        |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | -------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- |
| Time   | time   | = new | Time(11, | 59, | 59.9); |     |     |
Overloading constructors provides the flexibility to create an object first and
then fill in the attributes, or collect all the information before creating the
object itself.
Once you get the hang of it, writing constructors gets boring. You can write
them quickly just by looking at the list of instance variables. In fact, some
| IDEs   | can generate |             | them for you.    |      |         |     |     |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------- | ---------------- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- |
| Here   | is the       | complete    | class definition |      | so far: |     |     |

|        | private      | int         | hour;            |      |         |     |     |
|        | private      | int         | minute;          |      |         |     |     |
|        | private      | double      | second;          |      |         |     |     |
|        | public       | Time()      | {                |      |         |     |     |
|        |              | this.hour   | = 0;             |      |         |     |     |
|        |              | this.minute | =                | 0;   |         |     |     |
|        |              | this.second | =                | 0.0; |         |     |     |
}

|     |        | this.minute | =       | minute; |         |                  |     |
|     |        | this.second | =       | second; |         |                  |     |

Notice how the second constructor declares the parameters hour, minute, and
second. Java allows you to declare parameters (and local variables) with the
same names as instance variables. They don’t have to use the same names,
| but | it’s common |     | practice. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The right side of this.hour = hour; refers to the parameter hour, since it
was declared most recently. This situation is called shadowing, because the
| parameter |     | “hides” | the | instance | variable |     | with the | same name. |     |
| --------- | --- | ------- | --- | -------- | -------- | --- | -------- | ---------- | --- |
Java provides the keyword this so you can access instance variables, regard-
less of shadowing. As a result, this constructor copies the values from the
| parameters |         | to the | instance | variables. |         |     |     |     |     |

Recall that the instance variables of Time are private. We can access them
from within the Time class, but if we try to read or write them from another
| class, | the compiler |     | reports | an  | error. |     |     |     |     |

A class that uses objects defined in another class is called a client. For
| example, | here   | is                             | a new      | class | called        | TimeClient: |            |             |       |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----- |
| public   |        | class                          | TimeClient |       | {             |             |            |             |       |
|          | public | static                         |            | void  | main(String[] |             | args)      | {           |       |
|          |        | Time                           | time       | = new | Time(11,      |             | 59, 59.9); |             |       |
|          |        | System.out.println(time.hour); |            |       |               |             |            | // compiler | error |
}
}
If you compile this code, you get an error message like “hour has private access
| in Time”. |         | There        | are three | ways      | to  | solve    | this problem: |     |     |

| •         | Make    | the instance |           | variables |     | public.  |               |     |     |
| •         | Provide | methods      |           | to access | the | instance | variables.    |     |     |
• Decide that it’s not a problem and refuse to let other classes access the
|     | instance | variables. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 11.4 Getters |     | and Setters |     |     |     |     |     | 189 |
| ------------ | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The first choice is appealing because it’s simple. But here is the problem:
when class A accesses the instance variables of class B directly, A becomes
dependent on B. If anything in B changes later, it is likely that A will have
| to change | too. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
But if A uses only methods to interact with B, A and B are less dependent,
whichmeans thatwecan make changes inB without affectingA(as longaswe
don’t change the method parameters). So we generally avoid making instance
| variables | public. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The second option is to provide methods that access the instance variables.
For example, we might want the instance variables to be “read only”; that is,
code in other classes should be able to read them but not write them. We can
| do that | by providing | one        | method | for each | instance | variable: |     |     |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | --------- | --- | --- |
| public  | int          | getHour()  | {      |          |          |           |     |     |
|         | return       | this.hour; |        |          |          |           |     |     |
}
| public | int    | getMinute()  |     | {   |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return | this.minute; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
}
| public | double | getSecond()  |     | {   |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return | this.second; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
}
Methods like these are formally called “accessors”, but more commonly re-
ferred to as getters. By convention, the method that gets a variable named
| something | is called        | getSomething. |          |            |     |           |         |     |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --------- | ------- | --- |
| We can    | fix the compiler |               | error in | TimeClient | by  | using the | getter: |     |
System.out.println(time.getHour());
If we decide that TimeClient should also be able to modify the instance vari-
| ables of | Time, we | can provide | methods |     | to do that | too: |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ---- | --- | --- |

| 190    |           |             |     |       | Chapter | 11 Designing | Classes |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | --- | ----- | ------- | ------------ | ------- |
| public | void      | setHour(int |     | hour) | {       |              |         |
|        | this.hour | = hour;     |     |       |         |              |         |
}
| public | void        | setMinute(int |         | minute) | {   |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | this.minute | =             | minute; |         |     |     |     |
}
| public | void        | setSecond(double |         |     | second) { |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------- | ------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- |
|        | this.second | =                | second; |     |           |     |     |
}
These methods are formally called “mutators”, but more commonly known as
setters. The naming convention is similar; the method that sets something
| is usually | called | setSomething. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Writing getters and setters can get boring, but many IDEs can generate them
| for you | based      | on the instance | variables. |     |     |     |     |

| 11.5    | Displaying |                 | Objects    |     |     |     |     |
To display Time objects, we can write a method to display the hour, minute,
and second. Using printTime in Section 4.4 as a starting point, we could write
the following:
| public | static | void | printTime(Time |     | t) { |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | -------------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
System.out.print(t.hour);
System.out.print(":");
System.out.print(t.minute);
System.out.print(":");
System.out.println(t.second);
}
The output of this method, given the time object from the first example,
would be 11:59:59.9. We can use printf to make the code more concise:
| public | static | void | printTime(Time |     | t) { |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | -------------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
System.out.printf("%02d:%02d:%04.1f\n",
|     | t.hour, | t.minute, |     | t.second); |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
}

| 11.6 | The | toString |     | Method |     |     |     |     | 191 |
| ---- | --- | -------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
As a reminder, you need to use %d with integers, and %f with floating-point
numbers. The 02 option means “total width 2, with leading zeros if necessary”,
and the 04.1 option means “total width 4, one digit after the decimal point,
| leading | zeros | if necessary”. |     |     | The output | is  | the same: | 11:59:59.9. |     |
| ------- | ----- | -------------- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | --------- | ----------- | --- |
There’s nothing wrong with a method like printTime, but it is not consistent
with object-oriented style. A more idiomatic solution is to provide a special
| method | called | toString. |          |     |        |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | -------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11.6   |        | The       | toString |     | Method |     |     |     |     |
EveryobjecthasamethodcalledtoStringthatreturnsastringrepresentation
of the object. When you display an object using print or println, Java
| invokes | the | object’s | toString |     | method. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | -------- | -------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
By default, it simply displays the type of the object and its address in hex-
adecimal. So, say you create a Time object and display it with println:
| public |      | static | void | main(String[] |          |     | args)  | {   |     |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------------- | -------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- |
|        | Time | time   | =    | new           | Time(11, | 59, | 59.9); |     |     |
System.out.println(time);
}
| The | output | looks | something |     | like this: |     |     |     |     |

Thisaddresscanbeusefulfordebugging,ifyouwanttokeeptrackofindividual
objects.
But you can override this behavior by providing your own toString method.
| For    | example, | here       | is a                                | toString     | method |     | for Time:     |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ | --- | ------------- | --- | --- |
| public |          | String     | toString()                          |              | {      |     |               |     |     |
|        | return   |            | String.format("%02d:%02d:%04.1f\n", |              |        |     |               |     |     |
|        |          | this.hour, |                                     | this.minute, |        |     | this.second); |     |     |
}
The definition does not have the keyword static, because it is not a static
method. It is an instance method, so called because when you invoke it, you

| 192 |     |     |     |     |     |     | Chapter | 11 Designing | Classes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ------------ | ------- |
invoke it on an instance of the class. Instance methods are sometimes called
| “non-static”; |     | you | might see | this | term | in an | error | message. |     |
| ------------- | --- | --- | --------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | -------- | --- |
The body of the method is similar to printTime in the previous section, with
two changes:
• Inside the method, we use this to refer to the current instance; that is,
|     | the | object | the method | is  | invoked | on. |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------ | ---------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• Instead of printf, it uses String.format, which returns a formatted
|     | String    | rather   | than             | displaying |     | it.    |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| Now | you       | can call | toString         | directly:  |     |        |     |     |     |
|     | Time time | =        | new Time(11,     |            | 59, | 59.9); |     |     |     |
|     | String    | s =      | time.toString(); |            |     |        |     |     |     |
The value of s is the string "11:59:59.9". You can also invoke toString
| indirectly |     | by invoking | print |     | or println: |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
System.out.println(time);
This code displays the string "11:59:59.9". Either way, when you use this
| inside | toString, |     | it refers | to the | same | object | as  | time. |     |
| ------ | --------- | --- | --------- | ------ | ---- | ------ | --- | ----- | --- |
| 11.7   |           | The | equals    | Method |      |        |     |       |     |
We have seen two ways to check whether values are equal: the == operator
and the equals method. With objects, you can use either one, but they are
| not | the same: |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• The == operator checks whether two references are identical; that is,
|     | whether | they | refer | to the | same | object. |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
• The equals method checks whether two objects are equivalent; that
|     | is, whether |     | they have | the | same | values. |     |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | --- | --------- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |

| 11.7 | The | equals | Method |     |     |     |     |     | 193 |
| ---- | --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Thedefinitionofidentityisalwaysthesame,sothe==operatoralwaysdoesthe
same thing. But the definition of equivalence is different for different objects,
| so objects | can | define | their | own | equals | methods. |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- | ------ | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
Consider the following variables and the corresponding memory diagram in
Figure ??:
| Time  | time1 | =   | new Time(9, |     | 30, | 0.0); |     |           |     |
| ----- | ----- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --------- | --- |
| Time  | time2 | =   | time1;      |     |     |       |     |           |     |
| Time  | time3 | =   | new Time(9, |     | 30, | 0.0); |     |           |     |

|     | Figure |     | 11.2:  | Memory | diagram | of three | Time | variables. |     |
The assignment operator copies references, so time1 and time2 refer to the
same object. Because they are identical, time1 == time2 is true. But time1
and time3 refer to two different objects. Because they are not identical,
| time1 | == time3 |     | is false. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
By default, the equals method does the same thing as ==. For Time objects,
that’s probably not what we want. For example, time1 and time3 represent
| the same | time    | of day,                 | so          | we should | consider       | them           | equivalent. |            |     |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --- |
| We can   | provide | an                      | equals      | method    | that           | implements     |             | this idea: |     |
| public   | boolean |                         | equals(Time |           | that)          | {              |             |            |     |
|          | final   | double                  | DELTA       |           | = 0.001;       |                |             |            |     |
|          | return  | this.hour               |             | ==        | that.hour      |                |             |            |     |
|          |         | && this.minute          |             |           | == that.minute |                |             |            |     |
|          |         | && Math.abs(this.second |             |           |                | - that.second) |             | < DELTA;   |     |
}
equals is an instance method, so it doesn’t have the keyword static. It uses
this to refer to the current object, and that to refer to the other. that is not

| 194 |     |     |     |     |     | Chapter | 11 Designing | Classes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ------------ | ------- |
a keyword, so we could have given this parameter a different name. But using
| that makes |        | the code | nicely | readable. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| We can     | invoke | equals   | like   | this:     |     |     |     |     |
time1.equals(time3);
Inside the equals method, this refers to the same object as time1, and that
refers to the same object as time3. Since their instance variables are “equal”,
| the result | is  | true. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Because hour and minute are integers, we compare them with ==. But second
is a floating-point number. Because of rounding errors, it is not good to
compare floating-point numbers with == (see Section 2.7). Instead, we check
| whether | the | difference | is  | smaller | than | a threshold, | DELTA. |     |
| ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------- | ---- | ------------ | ------ | --- |
Many objects have a similar notion of equivalence; that is, two objects are
considered equal if their instance variables are equal. But other definitions are
possible.
| 11.8 | Adding |     | Times |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Suppose you are going to a movie that starts at 18:50 (that is, 6:50 PM), and
the running time is 2 hours, 16 minutes. What time does the movie end? We’ll
| use Time | objects     |      | to figure | it out:  |         |               |     |     |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ------------- | --- | --- |
| Time     | startTime   |      | = new     | Time(18, |         | 50, 0.0);     |     |     |
| Time     | runningTime |      | =         | new      | Time(2, | 16, 0.0);     |     |     |
| Here are | two         | ways | we could  | “add”    | the     | Time objects: |     |     |
• Write a static method that takes two Time objects as parameters.
• Write an instance method that gets invoked on one object and takes the
| other |     | as a parameter. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To demonstrate the difference, we’ll do both. Here is the static method:

|      | public | static     |       | Time        | add(Time |            | t1,        | Time t2) { |     |     |
|      |        | Time       | sum   | = new       | Time();  |            |            |            |     |     |
|      |        | sum.hour   |       | = t1.hour   |          | + t2.hour; |            |            |     |     |
|      |        | sum.minute |       | = t1.minute |          | +          | t2.minute; |            |     |     |
|      |        | sum.second |       | = t1.second |          | +          | t2.second; |            |     |     |
|      |        | return     | sum;  |             |          |            |            |            |     |     |
}
| And    | here’s | how        | we       | would                 | invoke  | it:        |              |               |     |     |

|        | Time   | endTime    |          | = Time.add(startTime, |         |            |              | runningTime); |     |     |
| Here’s | what   |            | it looks | like                  | as an   | instance   | method:      |               |     |     |
|        | public | Time       | add(Time |                       | t2)     | {          |              |               |     |     |
|        |        | Time       | sum      | = new                 | Time(); |            |              |               |     |     |
|        |        | sum.hour   |          | = this.hour           |         | + t2.hour; |              |               |     |     |
|        |        | sum.minute |          | = this.minute         |         |            | + t2.minute; |               |     |     |
|        |        | sum.second |          | = this.second         |         |            | + t2.second; |               |     |     |
|        |        | return     | sum;     |                       |         |            |              |               |     |     |
}
| And    | here’s | how          | we  | would                         | invoke | it: |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ | --- | ----------------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | Time   | endTime      |     | = startTime.add(runningTime); |        |     |     |     |     |     |
| Notice | the    | differences: |     |                               |        |     |     |     |     |     |
• The static method has the keyword static; the instance method does
not.
• The static method has two parameters, t1 and t2. The instance method
|     | has | one | explicit | parameter, |     | t2, | and | the implicit parameter, | this. |     |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | ----------------------- | ----- | --- |
• We invoked the static method with the Time class; we invoked the in-
|     | stance |     | method | with | the | startTime |     | object. |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ | ---- | --- | --------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
That’s all there is to it. Static methods and instance methods do the same
thing, and you can convert from one to the other with just a few changes.
However, there’s a problem with both of these methods; they are not correct.
The result from either method is 20:66, which is not a valid time.

| Here    | is a better    | version    | of the        | instance   | method,      | add: |     |

|         |                | sum.second | -=            | 60.0;      |              |      |     |

}
|     | if (sum.minute |            | >=    | 60) { |     |     |     |

Now you know that a class is also a template for a new type of object.
instance: A member of a class. Every object is an instance of a class.
instantiate: Create a new instance of a class in the computer’s memory.

three integers: year, month, and day. This class should provide two construc-
tors. The first should take no parameters and initialize a default date. The
second should take parameters named year, month and day, and use them to

4. Write a main method that creates a new object with type Rational,
sets its instance variables to the values of your choice, and displays the
object.
5. You now have a minimal testable program. Test it and, if necessary,
debug it.
6. Write a toString method for Rational and test it using println.
7. Write a second constructor that takes two arguments and uses them to
initialize the instance variables.
8. Write an instance method called negate that reverses the sign of a ra-
tional number. This method should be a modifier, so it should be void.
Add lines to main to test the new method.
9. Write an instance method called invert that swaps the numerator and
denominator. It should be a modifier. Add lines to main to test the new
method.
10. Write an instance method called toDouble that converts the rational
numberto adouble (floating-pointnumber) andreturns theresult. This
method is a pure method; it does not modify the object. As always, test
the new method.
11. Write an instance method named reduce that reduces a rational number
to its lowest terms by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the
numerator and denominator and dividing through. This method should
be a pure method; it should not modify the instance variables of the
object on which it is invoked.
Hint: Finding the GCD takes only a few lines of code. Search the web
for “Euclidean algorithm”.
12. Write an instance method called add that takes a Rational number as
anargument, addsittothis, andreturnsanewRationalobject. There
are several ways to add fractions. You can use any one you want, but
you should make sure that the result of the operation is reduced so that
the numerator and denominator have no common divisor (other than 1).

| Arrays  |     | of Objects |     |     |     |
During the next three chapters, we will develop programs that work with
playing cards and decks of cards. Here is an outline of the road ahead:
• In this chapter, we define a Card class and write methods that work with
| cards | and arrays | of cards. |     |     |     |
| ----- | ---------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
• InChapter??, wedefineaDeckclassthatencapsulatesanarrayofcards,
| and | we write | methods | that operate | on decks. |     |
| --- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- | --- |
• In Chapter ??, we introduce a way to define new classes that extend
existing classes. Then we use Card and Deck to implement the game
| Crazy | Eights. |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
There are 52 cards in a standard deck. Each card belongs to one of four suits
and one of 13 ranks. The suits are Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. The
| ranks | are Ace, 2, | 3, 4, 5, 6, | 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, | Queen, and | King. |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----- |
If you are unfamiliar with traditional playing cards, now would be a good time
to get a deck or read through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_
52-card_deck.

| 12.1 | Card | Objects |         |           |            |
If we want to define a class to represent a playing card, it is pretty clear what
the instance variables should be: rank and suit. It is not as obvious what
| types they | should be. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
OnepossibilityisaStringcontainingthingslike"Spade"forsuitsand"Queen"
for ranks. A problem with this choice is that it would not be easy to compare
| cards to | see which | had a higher | rank or suit. |     |     |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------- | --- | --- |
An alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and suits. By encode,
we don’t mean to encrypt or translate into a secret code. We mean to define a
mapping between a sequence of numbers and the things we want to represent.
| Here is a | mapping     | for suits: |     |     |     |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clubs     | (cid:55)→ 0 |            |     |     |     |
| Diamonds  | 1           |            |     |     |     |
(cid:55)→
| Hearts | (cid:55)→ 2 |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spades | 3           |     |     |     |     |
(cid:55)→
We use the mathematical symbol (cid:55)→ to make it clear that these mappings are
not part of the program. They are part of the program design, but they never
| appear explicitly | in  | the code. |     |     |     |
| ----------------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
Each of the numerical ranks (2 through 10) maps to the corresponding integer.
| For the face | cards,       | we can use the | following: |     |     |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| Ace          | (cid:55)→ 1  |                |            |     |     |
| Jack         | (cid:55)→ 11 |                |            |     |     |
| Queen        | 12           |                |            |     |     |
(cid:55)→
| King | (cid:55)→ 13 |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
With this encoding, the class definition for the Card type looks like this:

| 12.2   | Card    | toString   |       |         |     |       |     |     | 203 |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | ----- | ------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| public |         | class Card |       | {       |     |       |     |     |     |
|        | private | int        | rank; |         |     |       |     |     |     |
|        | private | int        | suit; |         |     |       |     |     |     |
|        | public  | Card(int   |       | rank,   | int | suit) | {   |     |     |
|        |         | this.rank  |       | = rank; |     |       |     |     |     |
|        |         | this.suit  |       | = suit; |     |       |     |     |     |
}
}
The instance variables are private: we can access them from inside this class,
| but | not from | other | classes. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The constructor takes a parameter for each instance variable. To create a Card
| object, | we           | use the new    | operator: |           |         |            |     |             |     |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
| Card    | threeOfClubs |                |           | = new     | Card(3, | 0);        |     |             |     |
| The     | result       | is a reference |           | to a Card | that    | represents | the | 3 of Clubs. |     |
| 12.2    |              | Card toString  |           |           |         |            |     |             |     |
When you create a new class, the first step is to declare the instance variables
and write constructors. A good next step is to write toString, which is useful
| for debugging |     | and incremental |     |     | development. |     |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --- | --------------- | --- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To display Card objects in a way that humans can read easily, we need to
“decode” the integer values as words. A natural way to do that is with an
| array    | of Strings. | For           | example, |               | we can | create | the array | like this: |     |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- | --- |
| String[] |             | suits         | = new    | String[4];    |        |        |           |            |     |
| And      | then        | assign values | to       | the elements: |        |        |           |            |     |
| suits[0] |             | = "Clubs";    |          |               |        |        |           |            |     |
| suits[1] |             | = "Diamonds"; |          |               |        |        |           |            |     |
| suits[2] |             | = "Hearts";   |          |               |        |        |           |            |     |
| suits[3] |             | = "Spades";   |          |               |        |        |           |            |     |

204 Chapter 12 Arrays of Objects
Or we can create the array and initialize the elements at the same time, as
you saw in Section ??:
String[] suits = {"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"};
The memory diagram in Figure ?? shows the result. Each element of the array
is a reference to a String.
suits "Clubs"
"Diamonds"
"Hearts"
"Spades"
Figure 12.1: Memory diagram of an array of strings.
We also need an array to decode the ranks:
String[] ranks = {null, "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6",
"7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"};
The zeroth element should never be used, because the only valid ranks are
1–13. We set it to null to indicate an unused element.
Using these arrays, we can create a meaningful String by using suit and
rank as indexes.
String s = ranks[this.rank] + " of " + suits[this.suit];
Theexpressionranks[this.rank]means“usetheinstancevariablerankfrom
this object as an index into the array ranks.” We select the string for
this.suit in a similar way.
Now we can wrap all the previous code in a toString method:
public String toString() {
String[] ranks = {null, "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6",
"7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"};
String[] suits = {"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"};
String s = ranks[this.rank] + " of " + suits[this.suit];
return s;
}

When we display a card, println automatically calls toString. The output
| of the | following | code | is           | Jack | of Diamonds: |     |     |     |
| ------ | --------- | ---- | ------------ | ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |

| 12.3 | Class |     | Variables |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ----- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
So far you have seen local variables, which are declared inside a method, and
instance variables, which are declared in a class definition, usually before the
method definitions. Now it’s time to learn about variables. They are
class
| shared | across | all | instances | of  | the class. |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | --- | --------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
Like instance variables, class variables are defined in a class definition, before
the method definitions. But they are identified by the keyword static. Here
is a version of Card in which RANKS and SUITS are defined as class variables:
| public |        | class    | Card             | {           |          |                  |                          |     |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | --- |
|        | public | static   |                  | final       | String[] | RANKS            | = {                      |     |
|        |        | null,    | "Ace",           | "2",        |          | "3", "4",        | "5", "6", "7",           |     |
|        |        | "8",     | "9",             | "10",       | "Jack",  | "Queen",         | "King"};                 |     |
|        | public | static   |                  | final       | String[] | SUITS            | = {                      |     |
|        |        | "Clubs", |                  | "Diamonds", |          | "Hearts",        | "Spades"};               |     |
|        | //     | instance | variables        |             |          | and constructors | go here                  |     |
|        | public | String   |                  | toString()  |          | {                |                          |     |
|        |        | return   | RANKS[this.rank] |             |          | + "              | of " + SUITS[this.suit]; |     |
}
}
Class variables are allocated when the program begins and persist until the
program ends. In contrast, instance variables like rank and suit are allocated
when the program creates new objects, and they are deleted when the object
| is garbage-collected |     |     | (see | Section | ??). |     |     |     |
| -------------------- | --- | --- | ---- | ------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |

| 206 |     |     | Chapter | 12 Arrays | of Objects |
| --- | --- | --- | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
Class variables are often used to store constant values that are needed in
several places. In that case, they should also be declared as final. Note that
whether a variable is static or final involves two separate considerations:
static means the variable is shared, and final means the variable (or in this
| case, the | reference) | is constant. |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
Naming static final variables with capital letters is a common convention
that makes it easier to recognize their role in the class. In the toString
method, we refer to SUITS and RANKS as if they were local variables, but we
| can tell | that they | are class variables. |     |     |     |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
OneadvantageofdefiningSUITSandRANKSasclassvariablesisthattheydon’t
needtobecreated(andgarbage-collected)everytimetoStringiscalled. They
may also be needed in other methods and classes, so it’s helpful to make them
| available | everywhere. |           |        |     |     |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- | ------ | --- | --- |
| 12.4      | The         | compareTo | Method |     |     |
As you saw in Section ??, it’s helpful to create an equals method to test
| whether | two objects      | are equivalent: |            |     |     |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| public  | boolean          | equals(Card     | that) {    |     |     |
|         | return this.rank | ==              | that.rank  |     |     |
|         | && this.suit     | ==              | that.suit; |     |     |
}
Itwouldalsobenicetohaveamethodforcomparingcards, sowecantellifone
is higher or lower than another. For primitive types, we can use comparison
operators like < and > to compare values. But these operators don’t work for
object types.
For strings, Java provides a compareTo method, as you saw in Section ??. We
can write our own version of compareTo for the classes that we define, as we
| did for | the equals | method. |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
Some types are “totally ordered”, which means that you can compare any two
values and tell which is bigger. Integers and strings are totally ordered. Other
typesare“unordered”, whichmeansthatthereisnomeaningfulwaytosaythat

| 12.5 | Cards | Are | Immutable |     |     |     | 207 |
| ---- | ----- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
one element is bigger than another. In Java, the boolean type is unordered;
| if you | try | to compare | true < | false, | you | get a compiler error. |     |
| ------ | --- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | --- | --------------------- | --- |
The set of playing cards is “partially ordered”, which means that sometimes
we can compare cards and sometimes not. For example, we know that the 3
of Clubs is higher than the 2 of Clubs, and the 3 of Diamonds is higher than
the 3 of Clubs. But which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One
| has | a higher | rank, | but the other | has | a higher | suit. |     |
| --- | -------- | ----- | ------------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- |
To make cards comparable, we have to decide which is more important: rank
or suit. The choice is arbitrary, and it might be different for different games.
But when you buy a new deck of cards, it comes sorted with all the Clubs
together, followed by all the Diamonds, and so on. So for now, let’s say that
suit is more important. With that decided, we can write compareTo as follows:
| public |     | int compareTo(Card |              |     | that) { |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ------------------ | ------------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
|        | if  | (this.suit         | < that.suit) |     | {       |     |     |
|        |     | return             | -1;          |     |         |     |     |
}
|     | if  | (this.suit | > that.suit) |     | {   |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | return     | 1;           |     |     |     |     |
}
|     | if  | (this.rank | < that.rank) |     | {   |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | return     | -1;          |     |     |     |     |
}
|     | if  | (this.rank | > that.rank) |     | {   |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | return     | 1;           |     |     |     |     |
}
|     | return | 0;  |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
compareTo returns -1 if this is a lower card, +1 if this is a higher card, and
0 if this and that are equivalent. It compares suits first. If the suits are the
same, it compares ranks. If the ranks are also the same, it returns 0.
| 12.5 |     | Cards | Are Immutable |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | ----- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The instance variables of Card are private, so they can’t be accessed from
other classes. We can provide getters to allow other classes to read the rank

| 208      |                   |     | Chapter | 12 Arrays | of Objects |
| -------- | ----------------- | --- | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| and suit | values:           |     |         |           |            |
| public   | int getRank()     | {   |         |           |            |
|          | return this.rank; |     |         |           |            |
}
| public | int getSuit()     | {   |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return this.suit; |     |     |     |     |
}
Whether or not to provide setters is a design decision. If we did, cards would
be mutable, so you could transform one card into another. That is probably
not a feature we want, and in general, mutable objects are more error-prone.
So it might be better to make cards immutable. To do that, all we have to do
| is not | provide any | modifier methods | (including | setters). |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------- | --- |
That’s easy enough, but it is not foolproof, because a fool might come along
later and add a modifier. We can prevent that possibility by declaring the
| instance | variables     | final:    |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
| public   | class         | Card {    |     |     |     |
|          | private final | int rank; |     |     |     |
|          | private final | int suit; |     |     |     |
...
}
You can initialize these variables inside a constructor, but if someone writes a
method that tries to modify them, they’ll get a compiler error. This kind of
| safeguard | helps prevent | future mistakes | and | hours of debugging. |     |

| 12.6      | Arrays        | of Cards        |     |                     |     |
Just as you can create an array of String objects, you can create an array of
Card objects. The following statement creates an array of 52 cards. Figure
??
| shows  | the memory | diagram for this array. |     |     |     |

|     | Figure |     | 12.2: Memory |     | diagram | of  | an unpopulated | Card array. |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------------ | --- | ------- | --- | -------------- | ----------- | --- |
Although we call it an “array of cards”, the array contains references to cards;
it does not contain the Card objects themselves. Initially the references are
all null.
Even so, you can access the elements of the array in the usual way:
| if  | (cards[0]              |     | ==  | null) | {   |      |         |     |     |
| --- | ---------------------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- |
|     | System.out.println("No |     |     |       |     | card | yet!"); |     |     |
}
But if you try to access the instance variables of non-existent Card objects,
| you                                | will get | a NullPointerException: |     |     |     |     |                         |     |     |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------------------- | --- | --- |
| System.out.println(cards[0].rank); |          |                         |     |     |     |     | // NullPointerException |     |     |
That code won’t work until we put cards in the array. One way to populate
| the | array | is to        | write nested | for     | loops: |            |         |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| int | index |              | = 0;         |         |        |            |         |     |     |
| for | (int  | suit         | =            | 0; suit | <=     | 3; suit++) | {       |     |     |
|     | for   | (int         | rank         | = 1;    | rank   | <= 13;     | rank++) | {   |     |
|     |       | cards[index] |              |         | = new  | Card(rank, | suit);  |     |     |
index++;
}
}
The outer loop iterates suits from 0 to 3. For each suit, the inner loop iterates
ranks from 1 to 13. Since the outer loop runs 4 times, and the inner loop runs
| 13 times |     | for each | suit, | the body | is executed |     | 52 times. |     |     |
| -------- | --- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- |
We use a separate variable index to keep track of where in the array the next
card should go. Figure shows what the array looks like after the first two
??
| cards | have | been | created. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
When you work with arrays, it is convenient to have a method that displays
the contents. You have seen the pattern for traversing an array several times,
| so the | following |     | method | should | be  | familiar: |     |     |     |

System.out.println(card);
}
}
Since cards has type Card[], pronounced “card array”, an element of cards
has type Card. So println invokes the toString method in the Card class.
Then again, we don’t have to write our own printDeck method. The Arrays
class provides a toString method that invokes toString on the elements of
| an array | and | concatenates |     | the results: |     |     |     |

| 12.7 |     | Sequential |     | Search |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
The next method we’ll write is search, which takes an array of cards and a
Card object as parameters. It returns the index where the Card appears in
the array, or -1 if it doesn’t. This version of search uses the algorithm in
| Section | ??, | which | is called | sequential | search: |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ----- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- |

| 12.8 | Binary |        | Search                    |               |                 |        |      |           | 211 |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------ | ---- | --------- | --- |
|      | public | static | int                       | search(Card[] |                 | cards, | Card | target) { |     |
|      | for    | (int   | i =                       | 0; i          | < cards.length; |        | i++) | {         |     |
|      |        | if     | (cards[i].equals(target)) |               |                 |        | {    |           |     |
|      |        |        | return                    | i;            |                 |        |      |           |     |
}
}
|     | return |     | -1; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
The method returns as soon as it discovers the card, which means we don’t
have to traverse the entire array if we find the target. If we get to the end of
| the | loop, | we know | the card | is  | not in | the array. |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ------- | -------- | --- | ------ | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
If the cards in the array are not in order, there is no way to search faster than
sequential search. We have to look at every card, because otherwise we can’t
be certain the card we want is not there. But if the cards are in order, we can
| use | better | algorithms. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Sequential search is relatively inefficient, especially for large arrays. If you pay
the price to keep the array sorted, finding elements becomes much easier.

When you look for a word in a dictionary, you don’t search page by page from
front to back. Since the words are in alphabetical order, you probably use a
algorithm:
| binary | search   |     |             |     |        |        |             |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | --- | ----------- | --- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | --- | --- |
|        | 1. Start | on  | a page near | the | middle | of the | dictionary. |     |     |
2. Compare a word on the page to the word you are looking for. If you find
|     | it, stop. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
3. If the word on the page comes before the word you are looking for, flip
|     | to somewhere |     | later | in the | dictionary | and | go to | step 2. |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | --- | ----- | ------- | --- |
4. If the word on the page comes after the word you are looking for, flip to
|     | somewhere |     | earlier | in the | dictionary | and | go to | step 2. |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | --- | ----- | ------- | --- |

212 Chapter 12 Arrays of Objects
This algorithm is much faster than sequential search, because it rules out half
of the remaining words each time you make a comparison. If at any point you
find two adjacent words on the page, and your word comes between them, you
can conclude that your word is not in the dictionary.
Getting back to the array of cards, we can write a faster version of search if
we know the cards are in order:
public static int binarySearch(Card[] cards, Card target) {
int low = 0;
int high = cards.length - 1;
while (low <= high) {
int mid = (low + high) / 2; // step 1
int comp = cards[mid].compareTo(target);
if (comp == 0) { // step 2
return mid;
} else if (comp < 0) { // step 3
low = mid + 1;
} else { // step 4
high = mid - 1;
}
}
return -1;
}
First, we declare low and high variables to represent the range we are search-
ing. Initially, we search the entire array, from 0 to cards.length - 1.
Inside the while loop, we repeat the four steps of binary search:
1. Choose an index between low and high—call it mid—and compare the
card at mid to the target.
2. If you found the target, return its index (which is mid).
3. Ifthecardatmidislowerthanthetarget, searchtherangefrommid + 1
to high.
4. If the card at mid is higher than the target, search the range from low
to mid - 1.

If low exceeds high, there are no cards in the range, so we terminate the loop
| and return | -1. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
This algorithm depends on only the compareTo method of the object, so we
| can use | this    | code with | any | object type | that | provides compareTo. |     |

To see how binary search works, it’s helpful to add the following print state-
| ment at                | the | beginning | of the | loop:  |          |     |     |
| ---------------------- | --- | --------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | --- | --- |
| System.out.println(low |     |           |        | + ", " | + high); |     |     |
Using a sorted deck of cards, we can search for the Jack of Clubs like this:
| Card                                   | card | = new | Card(11, | 0); |     |         |     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | ------- | --- |
| System.out.println(binarySearch(cards, |      |       |          |     |     | card)); |     |
We expect to find this card at position 10 (since the Ace of Clubs is at position
| 0). Here | is the | output | of binarySearch: |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
0, 51
0, 24
0, 11
6, 11
9, 11
10
You can see the range of cards shrinking as the while loop runs, until even-
tually index 10 is found. If we search for a card that’s not in the array—like
| new Card(15, |     | 1), | or the 15 | of Diamonds—we |     | get the following: |     |
| ------------ | --- | --- | --------- | -------------- | --- | ------------------ | --- |
0, 51

26, 37

Each time through the loop, we cut the distance between low and high in
half. After k iterations, the number of remaining cards is 52/2k. To find the
number of iterations it takes to complete, we set 52/2k = 1 and solve for k.
The result is 52, which is about 5.7. So we might have to look at 5 or 6

More generally, if the array contains n elements, binary search requires log n

comparisons, and sequential search requires n. For large values of n, binary
| search | is  | substantially |     | faster. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

The variable images refers to a 2D array of Image objects, which are defined
in the java.awt package. Here’s the code that creates the array itself:
|     | images | =   | new Image[14][4]; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The array has 14 rows (one for each rank, plus an unused row for rank 0) and
4 columns (one for each suit). Here’s the loop that populates the array:

|        | for  | (int               | rank =                             | 1; rank | <= 13;     | rank++)                  | {         |            |
|        |      | String             | s = String.format("%s/%02d%c.gif", |         |            |                          |           |            |
|        |      |                    |                                    |         |            | cardset,                 | rank, c); |            |

}
}
The variable cardset is the name of the directory that contains the image
files. suits is a string that contains the single-letter abbreviations for the
suits. These strings are used to assemble s, which contains the filename
for each image. For example, when rank=1 and suit=2, the value of s is
"cardset-oxymoron/01h.gif", which is an image of the Ace of Hearts.
The last line of the loop reads the image file, extracts an Image object, and
assigns it to a location in the array, as specified by the indexes rank and suit.
For example, the image of the Ace of Hearts is stored in row 1, column 2.
If you compile and run CardTable.java, you should see images of a deck of
cards laid out on a green table. You can use this class as a starting place to
| implement |     | your own | card games. |     |     |     |     |     |

As a starting place, try placing cards on the table in the starting configu-
ration for the solitaire game Klondike (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Klondike_(solitaire)).
You can get the image for the back of the card by reading the file back192.gif.

We’ll add another constructor that creates a standard 52-card array and pop-
| ulates | it         | with Card | objects:          |      |           |      |            |             |        |     |

|        | this.cards |           | =                 | new  | Card[52]; |      |            |             |        |     |
|        | int        | index     | =                 | 0;   |           |      |            |             |        |     |
|        | for        | (int      | suit              | =    | 0; suit   | <=   | 3; suit++) | {           |        |     |
|        |            | for       | (int              | rank | = 1;      | rank | <=         | 13; rank++) | {      |     |
|        |            |           | this.cards[index] |      |           |      | = new      | Card(rank,  | suit); |     |
index++;
}
}
}
This method is similar to the example in Section ??; we just turned it into a
| constructor. |     | We   | can use | it      | to create | a   | complete | Deck | like this: |     |
| ------------ | --- | ---- | ------- | ------- | --------- | --- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | --- |
| Deck         |     | deck | = new   | Deck(); |           |     |          |      |            |     |
Now that we have a Deck class, we have a logical place to put methods that
pertain to decks. Looking at the methods we have written so far, one obvious
candidate is printDeck from Section ??. Here’s how it looks, rewritten as an
| instance |     | method | of Deck: |     |             |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ------ | -------- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public   |     | void   | print()  |     | {           |     |     |     |     |     |
|          | for | (Card  | card     | :   | this.cards) |     | {   |     |     |     |
System.out.println(card);

For most card games, you have to shuffle the deck; that is, put the cards in a
random order. In Section ?? you saw how to generate random numbers, but
| it is not | obvious | how | to use them | to shuffle | a deck. |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------- | --- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
One possibility is to model the way humans shuffle; for example, we could
divide the deck in two halves and then choose alternately from each one.
Humans usually don’t shuffle perfectly, so after about seven iterations, the
| order of | the deck | is pretty | well | randomized. |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | --------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
But a computer program would have the annoying property of doing a perfect
shuffle every time, which is not very random. In fact, after eight perfect
shuffles, you would find the deck back in the order you started in! For more
| on this, | see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faro_shuffle. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A better shuffling algorithm is to traverse the deck one card at a time, and
at each iteration, choose two cards and swap them. To outline this algorithm,
we’ll use a combination of Java statements and English comments. This tech-
| nique is | sometimes | called    | pseudocode: |          |                     |              |      |     |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ---- | --- |
| public   | void      | shuffle() | {           |          |                     |              |      |     |
|          | for each  | index     | i {         |          |                     |              |      |     |
|          | //        | choose    | a random    | number   | between             | i and length | -    | 1   |
|          | //        | swap      | the ith     | card and | the randomly-chosen |              | card |     |
}
}
The nice thing about pseudocode is that it often makes clear what other meth-
ods you are going to need. In this case, we need a method that chooses a
random integer in a given range and a method that takes two indexes and
| swaps | the cards | at those | positions: |     |     |     |     |     |

| ------- | --- | --------- | --- | ------------- | ------ | --- | ------- | --- | ---------- | --------- |
| private |     | static    | int | randomInt(int |        |     | low,    | int | high) {    |           |
|         | //  | return    | a   | random        | number |     | between | low | and high,  |           |
|         | //  | including |     | both          |        |     |         |     |            |           |
}
| private |     | void | swapCards(int |     |         | i,  | int j) | {   |           |     |
| ------- | --- | ---- | ------------- | --- | ------- | --- | ------ | --- | --------- | --- |
|         | //  | swap | the           | ith | and the | jth | cards  | in  | the array |     |
}
Methods like randomInt and swapCards are called helper methods, because
they help you solve parts of the problem. Helper methods are often private,
because they are used only by methods in the class and are not needed by
| methods | in  | other | classes. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The process of writing pseudocode first and then writing helper methods to
| make | it work | is  | a kind | of  |          |     |        | (see | https://en.wikipedia. |     |

org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design). It is an alternative to “incre-
mental development” and “encapsulation and generalization”, the other design
| processes | you | have | seen | in  | this book. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
One of the exercises at the end of the chapter asks you to write the helper
methods randomInt and swapCards, and use them to implement shuffle.
When you do the exercise, notice that randomInt is a class method and
| swapCards |           | is an | instance | method. |     | Do  | you understand |     | why? |     |
| --------- | --------- | ----- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | -------------- | --- | ---- | --- |
| 13.3      | Selection |       |          | Sort    |     |     |                |     |      |     |
Now that we have shuffled the deck, we need a way to put it back in order.
There is an algorithm for sorting that is ironically similar to the algorithm for
shuffling. It’s called selection sort, because it works by traversing the array
repeatedly and selecting the lowest (or highest) remaining card each time.
During the first iteration, we find the lowest card and swap it with the card
in the zeroth position. During the ith iteration, we find the lowest card to the
right of i and swap it with the ith card. Here is pseudocode for selection sort:

| 13.4 | Merge  |      | Sort            |            |      |      |       |        |       |       | 221 |
| ---- | ------ | ---- | --------------- | ---------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- | --- |
|      | public | void | selectionSort() |            |      | {    |       |        |       |       |     |
|      | for    | each | index           | i          | {    |      |       |        |       |       |     |
|      |        | //   | find            | the lowest |      | card | at or | to the | right | of i  |     |
|      |        | //   | swap            | the ith    | card | and  | the   | lowest | card  | found |     |
}
}
Again, the pseudocode helps with the design of the helper methods. For this
algorithm, we can reuse swapCards from the previous section, so we need only
| a   | method  | to find | the             | lowest | card; | we’ll call | it indexLowest: |       |      |     |     |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --------------- | ------ | ----- | ---------- | --------------- | ----- | ---- | --- | --- |
|     | private | int     | indexLowest(int |        |       | low,       | int             | high) | {    |     |     |
|     | //      | find    | the             | lowest | card  | between    | low             | and   | high |     |     |
}
One of the exercises at the end of the chapter asks you to write indexLowest,
| and  | then | use it | and swapCards |      | to  | implement | selectionSort. |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ------------- | ---- | --- | --------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13.4 |      | Merge  |               | Sort |     |           |                |     |     |     |     |
Selection sort is a simple algorithm, but it is not very efficient. To sort n
items, it has to traverse the array n−1 times. Each traversal takes an amount
of time proportional to n. The total time, therefore, is proportional to n2.
We will develop a more efficient algorithm called sort. To sort items,
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | merge |     | n   |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
merge sort takes time proportional to n. That may not seem impressive,
nlog
2
| but | as  | gets big, | the | difference | between |     | and |      | can | be enormous. |     |
| --- | --- | --------- | --- | ---------- | ------- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ------------ | --- |
|     | n   |           |     |            |         |     | n2  | nlog | n   |              |     |
2
For example, log of one million is around 20. So if you had to sort a million
2
numbers, merge sort would require 20 million steps. But selection sort would
| require | one | trillion | steps! |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The idea behind merge sort is this: if you have two decks, each of which has
already been sorted, you can quickly merge them into a single, sorted deck.
| Try | this | out with | a deck | of  | cards: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ------ | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
1. Form two decks with about 10 cards each, and sort them so they are face
|     | up  | with the | lowest | cards | on  | top. Place | the | decks | in front | of you. |     |
| --- | --- | -------- | ------ | ----- | --- | ---------- | --- | ----- | -------- | ------- | --- |

| 222 |     |     |     |     |     |     | Chapter | 13 Objects | of Arrays |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
2. Compare the top card from each deck and choose the lower one. Flip it
|     | over | and | add it | to the | merged | deck. |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
3. Repeat step 2 until one of the decks is empty. Then take the remaining
|     | cards | and | add | them | to the | merged | deck. |     |     |
| --- | ----- | --- | --- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ----- | --- | --- |
The result should be a single sorted deck. In the next few sections, we’ll
| explain |     | how to   | implement |     | this algorithm |     | in Java. |     |     |
| ------- | --- | -------- | --------- | --- | -------------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- |
| 13.5    |     | Subdecks |           |     |                |     |          |     |     |
The first step of merge sort is to split the deck into two “subdecks”, each with
about half of the cards. So we need a method that takes a deck, and a range
of indexes, and returns a new deck that contains the specified subset of cards:
|     | public | Deck         | subdeck(int |      | low,                  |     | int high) | {      |     |
| --- | ------ | ------------ | ----------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- | --------- | ------ | --- |
|     | Deck   |              | sub =       | new  | Deck(high             |     | - low     | + 1);  |     |
|     | for    | (int         | i           | = 0; | i < sub.cards.length; |     |           | i++) { |     |
|     |        | sub.cards[i] |             |      | = this.cards[low      |     |           | + i];  |     |
}
|     | return |     | sub; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
The first line creates an unpopulated Deck object that contains an array of
null references. Inside the for loop, the subdeck gets populated with refer-
| ences | to  | Card | objects. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The length of the subdeck is high - low + 1, because both the low card and
the high card are included. This sort of computation can be confusing, and
forgetting the “+ 1” often leads to off-by-one errors. Drawing a picture is
| usually | the | best | way | to avoid | them. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ---- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Figure ?? is a memory diagram of a subdeck with low = 0 and high = 4.
The result is a hand with five cards that are shared with the original deck;
| that | is, | they are | aliased. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Aliasing might not be a good idea, because changes to shared cards would be
reflected in multiple decks. But since Card objects are immutable, this kind of
aliasing is not a problem. And it saves some memory because we don’t create
| duplicate |     | Card | objects. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

An exercise at the end of the chapter asks you to implement merge. It’s a little
tricky, so be sure to test it with different subdecks. Once your merge method
is working, you can use it to write a simplified version of merge sort:
| public | Deck      | almostMergeSort() |               |      |       | {             |            |     |     |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---- | ----- | ------------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
|        | // divide |                   | the           | deck | into  | two subdecks  |            |     |     |
|        | // sort   | the               | subdecks      |      | using | selectionSort |            |     |     |
|        | // merge  |                   | the subdecks, |      |       | return        | the result |     |     |
}
If you have working versions of subdeck, selectionSort, and merge, you
should have no trouble getting this method working. But it is still not very
efficient, because it uses selectionSort to sort the subdecks. We can make
it more efficient if we use mergeSort instead, but that means we have to make
it recursive!
| 13.7 | Adding |     | Recursion |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------ | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To make mergeSort work recursively, you have to add a base case; otherwise,
it repeats forever. The simplest base case is a subdeck with one card. If there
is only one card, it can’t be out of order, so we consider it sorted. And if it is
| already | sorted, | we  | can just | return | it. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
And it will turn out to be convenient if we handle another base case, a subdeck
with zero cards. By the same logic, if there are no cards, they can’t be out of
| order. | So we | consider | an  | empty | deck | to be | sorted, and | return it. |     |
| ------ | ----- | -------- | --- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- | --- |
With these base cases, a recursive version of mergeSort looks like this:
| public | Deck          | mergeSort() |              |        | {     |           |          |          |     |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------ | ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- | --- |
|        | // if         | the         | deck         | has    | 0 or  | 1 cards,  | return   | it       |     |
|        | // otherwise, |             |              | divide | the   | deck      | into two | subdecks |     |

When you use selectionSort to sort the subdecks, you don’t feel compelled
to follow the flow of execution. You assume it works because you already
debuggedit. WhenyoumakemergeSortrecursive,youjustreplaceonesorting
algorithm with another. There is no reason to read the program differently.
Well, almost. You have to think about the base cases and make sure that you
reach them. But other than that, writing the recursive version should be no
problem. As an exercise at the end of this chapter, you’ll have a chance to
| finish off | this example. |         |     |     |     |

The helper methods randomInt and merge are static, because they do not
read or write any instance variables. All other methods are instance methods,
| because | they access | the instance variable, | cards. |     |     |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------ | --- | --- |
When you have static methods and instance methods in the same class, it is

| ------------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | --------- | --- | ------- | --------- |
| To invoke     | an   | instance |             | method, | you need | an      | instance: |     |         |           |
| Deck          | deck | =        | new Deck(); |         |          |         |           |     |         |           |
| deck.print(); |      |          | //          | correct |          |         |           |     |         |           |
Deck with a capital D is a class, and deck with a lowercase d is an object.
| Say you       | try        | to invoke | print | like    | this:  |     |               |     |      |     |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----- | ------- | ------ | --- | ------------- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Deck.print(); |            |           | //    | wrong!  |        |     |               |     |      |     |
| You get       | a compiler |           | error | like    | this:  |     |               |     |      |     |
| Non-static    |            | method    |       | print() | cannot |     | be referenced |     | from | a   |
| static        | context.   |           |       |         |        |     |               |     |      |     |
By “static context”, the compiler means you are trying to invoke a method in
| a context | that | requires |     | a static | method. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | --- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
On the other hand, if you have a Deck object, you can use it to invoke a static
method:
| Deck | deck | =                 | new Deck(); |     |      |     |        |     |     |            |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ----------- | --- | ---- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | ---------- |
| int  | i =  | deck.randomInt(0, |             |     | 51); | //  | legal, | but | not | good style |
This is legal, but it is not considered good style, because someone reading this
| code would | expect |     | randomInt |     | to be | an instance |     | method. |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | --- | --------- | --- | ----- | ----------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
Another common error is to use this in a static method. For example, say
| you write | something |             | like | this:      |           |     |      |     |     |     |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---------- | --------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| private   |           | static      | Deck | merge(Deck |           | d1, | Deck | d2) | {   |     |
|           | return    | this.cards; |      |            | // wrong! |     |      |     |     |     |
}
| You get    | a compiler |          | error | like | this:  |     |            |     |      |     |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- | ---- | ------ | --- | ---------- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Non-static |            | variable |       | this | cannot | be  | referenced |     | from | a   |
| static     | context.   |          |       |      |        |     |            |     |      |     |
The problem is that cards is an instance variable, so it is non-static; therefore,
you can’t access it from a static method. In general, you can’t use this in a
static method, because a static method is not invoked on an object.
For beginners, error messages about non-static context can be confusing and
| frustrating. |     | We hope | this | section | helps. |     |     |     |     |     |

| 13.9 | Piles of Cards |       | 227 |
| ---- | -------------- | ----- | --- |
| 13.9 | Piles of       | Cards |     |
Now that we have classes that represent cards and decks, let’s use them to
make a game. One of the simplest card games that children play is called
| “War” | (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). |     |     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
Initially, the deck is divided evenly into two piles, one for each player. During
each round, each player takes the top card from their pile and places it, face
up, in the center. Whoever has the highest-ranking card, ignoring suit, takes
the two cards and adds them to the bottom of their pile. The game continues
| until one | player has | won the entire deck. |     |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------- | --- |
We could use the Deck class to represent the individual piles. However, our
implementation of Deck uses a Card array, and the length of an array can’t
change. As the game progresses, we need to be able to add and remove cards
| from the | piles. |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | --- | --- |
We can solve this problem with an ArrayList, which is in the java.util
package. An ArrayList is a collection, which is an object that contains
other objects. It provides methods to add and remove elements, and it grows
| and shrinks | automatically. |     |     |
| ----------- | -------------- | --- | --- |
We define a new class named Pile to represent a pile of cards. It uses an
| ArrayList | to store                | Card objects:            |     |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --- |
| public    | class Pile              | {                        |     |
|           | private ArrayList<Card> | cards;                   |     |
|           | public Pile()           | {                        |     |
|           | this.cards              | = new ArrayList<Card>(); |     |
}
}
When you declare an ArrayList, you specify the type it contains in angle
brackets (<>). This declaration says that cards is not just an ArrayList; it’s
an ArrayList of Card objects. The constructor initializes this.cards with
| an empty | ArrayList. |     |     |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
Nowlet’sthinkaboutthemethodsweneedtoplaythegame. Atthebeginning
of each round, each player draws a card from the top of their pile. So we define
| a method | to do that: |     |     |
| -------- | ----------- | --- | --- |

| 228    |        |      |                       |     |     | Chapter |      | 13 Objects | of Arrays   |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | --------------------- | --- | --- | ------- | ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| public |        | Card | popCard()             | {   |     |         |      |            |             |
|        | return |      | this.cards.remove(0); |     |     | //      | from | the top    | of the pile |
}
popCard removes the Card at the beginning of the ArrayList, which we think
of as the top of the pile. Because we use ArrayList.remove, it automatically
| shifts | the | remaining | cards | to fill the | gap. |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | --------- | ----- | ----------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
At the end of each round, the winner adds cards to the bottom of their pile.
| So we  | define                | a method | to           | do that: |     |     |        |        |             |
| ------ | --------------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | --- | --- | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| public |                       | void     | addCard(Card | card)    |     | {   |        |        |             |
|        | this.cards.add(card); |          |              |          |     | //  | to the | bottom | of the pile |
}
ArrayList provides a method, add, that adds an element to the end of the
| collection, |     | which | we think | of as the | bottom | of  | the | pile. |     |
| ----------- | --- | ----- | -------- | --------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- | --- |
To know when to stop the game, we have to check if one of the piles is empty.
| Here’s | a method |         | to do that:           |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public |          | boolean | isEmpty()             | {   |     |     |     |     |     |
|        | return   |         | this.cards.isEmpty(); |     |     |     |     |     |     |
}
So far, these methods don’t do very much; they just invoke methods on the
instance variable, cards. Methods like these are called wrapper methods
| because | they | wrap | one method | with | another. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---------- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Finally, to start the game, we need to divide the deck into two equal parts.
We can do that with subdeck from Section ?? and a new method, addDeck:
| public |     | void  | addDeck(Deck | deck)              |     | {   |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ----- | ------------ | ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | for | (Card | card         | : deck.getCards()) |     |     | {   |     |     |
this.cards.add(card);
}
}
addDeck takes a Deck object, loops through the cards, and adds them to the
Pile. Notice that it does not remove the cards from the Deck, so the Deck
and the Pile share cards. But that won’t be a problem because cards are
immutable.

| 13.10 | Playing |     | War |     |     |     |     |     |
Now we can use Deck and Pile to implement the game. We’ll start by creating
| a deck | and shuffling: |       |         |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------------- | ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deck   | deck           | = new | Deck(); |     |     |     |     |     |
deck.shuffle();
| Then                        | we divide | the Deck      | into | two | piles: |     |     |     |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| Pile                        | p1        | = new Pile(); |      |     |        |     |     |     |
| p1.addDeck(deck.subdeck(0,  |           |               |      |     | 25));  |     |     |     |
| Pile                        | p2        | = new Pile(); |      |     |        |     |     |     |
| p2.addDeck(deck.subdeck(26, |           |               |      |     | 51));  |     |     |     |
The game itself is a loop that repeats until one of the piles is empty. At each
iteration, we draw a card from each pile and compare their ranks:
| while | (!p1.isEmpty() |                     |       | && !p2.isEmpty()) |                 | {   |     |     |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------- | ----- | ----------------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|       | // pop         | a card              | from  | each              | pile            |     |     |     |
|       | Card           | c1 = p1.popCard();  |       |                   |                 |     |     |     |
|       | Card           | c2 = p2.popCard();  |       |                   |                 |     |     |     |
|       | // compare     | the                 | cards |                   |                 |     |     |     |
|       | int            | diff = c1.getRank() |       |                   | - c2.getRank(); |     |     |     |
|       | if (diff       | > 0)                | {     |                   |                 |     |     |     |
p1.addCard(c1);
p1.addCard(c2);
|     | } else | if (diff |     | < 0) | {   |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | -------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
p2.addCard(c1);
p2.addCard(c2);
|     | } else | {       |       |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |        | // it's | a tie |     |     |     |     |     |
}
If the two cards have the same rank, it’s a tie. In that case, each player draws
four more cards. Whoever has the higher fourth card takes all cards in play.
| If there’s | another | tie, | they | draw | another four | cards, and | so on. |     |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | --- |

230 Chapter 13 Objects of Arrays
One of the exercises at the end of this chapter asks you to implement the else
block when there’s a tie.
After the while loop ends, we display the winner based on which pile is not
empty:
if (p2.isEmpty()) {
System.out.println("Player 1 wins!");
} else {
System.out.println("Player 2 wins!");
}
ArrayList provides many other methods that we didn’t use for this example.
Take a minute to read the documentation, which you can find by doing a web
search for “Java ArrayList”.

3. Using the pseudocode in Section ??, implement the merge method. The
best way to test it is to build and shuffle a deck. Then use subdeck to
form two small subdecks, and use selection sort to sort them. Finally,
|     | pass | the | two | halves | to merge | and | see if it | works. |     |     |
| --- | ---- | --- | --- | ------ | -------- | --- | --------- | ------ | --- | --- |
4. Fill in almostMergeSort, which divides the deck in half, then uses
selectionSort to sort the two halves, and uses merge to create a new,
sorted deck. You should be able to reuse code from the previous step.
5. Implement mergeSort recursively. Remember that selectionSort is
void and mergeSort returns a new Deck, which means that they get
|     | invoked |                       | differently:        |     |     |     |             |     |          |          |

|     |         | deck                  | = deck.mergeSort(); |     |     |     | // replaces | old | deck     | with new |

This site provides explanations of the algorithms, along with animations that
show how they work. It also includes an analysis of their efficiency.
For example, “insertion sort” is an algorithm that inserts elements into place,
one at a time. Read about it on the website and play the animations. Then
write a method named insertionSort that implements this algorithm.
One goal of this exercise is to practice top-down design. Your solution should
use a helper method, named insert, that implements the inner loop of the
| algorithm. |     | insertionSort |     |     | should | invoke | this method |     | times. |     |

In this chapter, we present a more comprehensive example of object-oriented
programming.
Eightsisaclassiccardgamefortwoormoreplayers. Themainobjective
Crazy
is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Here’s how to play:
• Deal five or more cards to each player, and then deal one card face up to
create the “discard pile”. Place the remaining cards face down to create
| the | “draw | pile”. |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
• Each player takes turns placing a single card on the discard pile. The
card must match the rank or suit of the previously played card, or be an
| eight, | which | is a | “wild card”. |     |     |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ------------ | --- | --- |
• When players don’t have a matching card or an eight, they must draw
| new | cards | until they | get one. |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | -------- | --- | --- |
• If the draw pile ever runs out, the discard pile is shuffled (except the top
| card) | and | becomes | the new draw | pile. |     |
| ----- | --- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --- |
• As soon as a player has no cards, the game ends, and all other players
score penalty points for their remaining cards. Eights are worth 20, face
| cards | are | worth 10, | and all others | are worth | their rank. |

| 14.1 | CardCollection |     |         |              |         |
To implement Crazy Eights, we need to represent a deck of cards, a discard
pile, a draw pile, and a hand for each player. And we need to be able to deal,
| draw, and | discard cards. |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The Deck and Pile classes from the previous chapter meet some of these
requirements. But unless we make some changes, neither of them represents a
| hand of | cards very well. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Furthermore, Deck and Pile are essentially two versions of the same code: one
based on arrays, and the other based on ArrayList. It would be helpful to
combine their features into one class that meets the needs of both.
We will define a class named CardCollection and add the code we want one
step at a time. Since this class will represent different piles and hands of cards,
| we’ll add | a label attribute            | to tell  | them apart:        |     |     |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
| public    | class CardCollection         |          | {                  |     |     |
|           | private String               | label;   |                    |     |     |
|           | private ArrayList<Card>      |          | cards;             |     |     |
|           | public CardCollection(String |          | label)             | {   |     |
|           | this.label                   | = label; |                    |     |     |
|           | this.cards                   | = new    | ArrayList<Card>(); |     |     |
}
}
As with the Pile class, we need a way to add cards to the collection. Here is
| the addCard | method from       | the previous | chapter: |     |     |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------ | -------- | --- | --- |
| public      | void addCard(Card |              | card) {  |     |     |
this.cards.add(card);
}
Until now, we have used this explicitly to make it easy to identify attributes.
Inside addCard and other instance methods, you can access instance variables
without using the keyword this. So from here on, we will drop it:

| 14.1   | CardCollection |     |              |     |         |     |     | 237 |
| ------ | -------------- | --- | ------------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| public | void           |     | addCard(Card |     | card) { |     |     |     |
cards.add(card);
}
We also need to be able to remove cards from the collection. The following
method takes an index, removes the card at that location, and shifts the
| following | cards  | left             | to fill     | the gap: |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------- | ----------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public    | Card   |                  | popCard(int | i)       | {   |     |     |     |
|           | return | cards.remove(i); |             |          |     |     |     |     |
}
If we are dealing cards from a shuffled deck, we don’t care which card gets
removed. It is most efficient to choose the last one, so we don’t have to shift
any cards left. Here is an overloaded version of popCard that removes and
| returns | the    | last card:  |              |     |      |             |            |      |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------ | --- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ---- |
| public  | Card   |             | popCard()    | {   |      |             |            |      |
|         | int    | i =         | cards.size() |     | - 1; | // from the | end of the | list |
|         | return | popCard(i); |              |     |      |             |            |      |
}
CardCollection also provides isEmpty, which returns true if there are no
| cards  | left, and | size,            | which     | returns | the number | of cards: |     |     |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- | --- | --- |
| public | boolean   |                  | isEmpty() |         | {          |           |     |     |
|        | return    | cards.isEmpty(); |           |         |            |           |     |     |
}
| public | int    | size()        | {   |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return | cards.size(); |     |     |     |     |     |     |
}
To access the elements of an ArrayList, you can’t use the array [] operator.
Instead, you have to use the methods get and set. Here is a wrapper for get:
| public | Card   |               | getCard(int | i)  | {   |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return | cards.get(i); |             |     |     |     |     |     |
}
| lastCard | gets | the | last card | (but | doesn’t remove | it): |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | --- | --------- | ---- | -------------- | ---- | --- | --- |

| 238    |        |      |                |     |     | Chapter |     | 14  | Extending | Classes |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | -------------- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --------- | ------- |
| public |        | Card | lastCard()     |     | {   |         |     |     |           |         |
|        | int    | i    | = cards.size() |     | -   | 1;      |     |     |           |         |
|        | return |      | cards.get(i);  |     |     |         |     |     |           |         |
}
In order to control the ways card collections are modified, we don’t provide
a wrapper for set. The only modifiers we provide are the two versions of
| popCard | and          | the  | following       | version        |     | of swapCards: |      |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------------- | -------------- | --- | ------------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| public  |              | void | swapCards(int   |                |     | i, int        | j) { |     |     |     |
|         | Card         | temp | = cards.get(i); |                |     |               |      |     |     |     |
|         | cards.set(i, |      |                 | cards.get(j)); |     |               |      |     |     |     |
|         | cards.set(j, |      |                 | temp);         |     |               |      |     |     |     |
}
Finally, we use swapCards to implement shuffle, which we described in Sec-
tion ??:
| public |        | void         | shuffle()            |              | {         |      |       |           |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---- | ----- | --------- | --- | --- |
|        | Random |              | random               | = new        | Random(); |      |       |           |     |     |
|        | for    | (int         | i =                  | cards.size() |           | - 1; | i     | > 0; i--) | {   |     |
|        |        | int          | j = random.nextInt(i |              |           |      | + 1); |           |     |     |
|        |        | swapCards(i, |                      | j);          |           |      |       |           |     |     |
}
}
| 14.2 |     | Inheritance |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
At this point, we have a class that represents a collection of cards. It provides
functionality common to decks of cards, piles of cards, hands of cards, and
| potentially |     | other | collections. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ----- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
However, each kind of collection will be slightly different. Rather than add
every possible feature to CardCollection, we can use to define
inheritance
subclasses. A is a class that “extends” an existing class; that is, it
subclass
| has | the attributes |     | and methods |     | of  | the existing | class, | plus | more. |     |
| --- | -------------- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | ------------ | ------ | ---- | ----- | --- |
Here is the complete definition of our new and improved Deck class:

14.2 Inheritance 239
| public | class | Deck        | extends | CardCollection |     |     | {   |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- | ------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| public |       | Deck(String |         | label)         | {   |     |     |
super(label);
|     | for | (int | suit =      | 0; suit | <=         | 3; suit++) | {         |
| --- | --- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
|     |     | for  | (int rank   | =       | 1; rank    | <= 13;     | rank++) { |
|     |     |      | addCard(new |         | Card(rank, | suit));    |           |
}
}
}
}
The first line uses the keyword extends to indicate that Deck extends the
class CardCollection. That means a Deck object has the same instance
variables and methods as a CardCollection. Another way to say the same
thing is that Deck “inherits from” CardCollection. We could also say that
CardCollection is a superclass, and Deck is one of its subclasses.
In Java, classes may extend only one superclass. Classes that do not specify a
superclass with extends automatically inherit from java.lang.Object. So in
this example, Deck extends CardCollection, which in turn extends Object.
The Object class provides the default equals and toString methods, among
other things.
Constructors are inherited, but all other public attributes and methods
not
are. The only additional method in Deck, at least for now, is a constructor.
| So you can | create | a     | Deck object   | like | this: |     |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- | ------------- | ---- | ----- | --- | --- |
| Deck       | deck   | = new | Deck("Deck"); |      |       |     |     |
The first line of the constructor uses super, which is a keyword that refers to
the superclass of the current class. When super is used as a method, as in
| this example, |     | it invokes | the constructor |     | of the | superclass. |     |
| ------------- | --- | ---------- | --------------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | --- |
So in this case, super invokes the CardCollection constructor, which initial-
izes the attributes label and cards. When it returns, the Deck constructor
resumes and populates the (empty) ArrayList with Card objects.
That’s it for the Deck class. Next we need a way to represent a hand, which
is the collection of cards held by a player, and a pile, which is a collection of

| 240 |     |     |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 14 Extending | Classes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ------------ | ------- |
cards on the table. We could define two classes, one for hands and one for
piles, but there is not much difference between them. So we’ll use one class,
called Hand, for both hands and piles. Here’s what the definition looks like:
| public |        | class       | Hand extends |     | CardCollection |     |     | {   |     |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------ | --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | public | Hand(String |              |     | label)         | {   |     |     |     |
super(label);
}
|     | public | void                          | display() |      | {           |     |      |          |     |
| --- | ------ | ----------------------------- | --------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | ---- | -------- | --- |
|     |        | System.out.println(getLabel() |           |      |             |     |      | + ": "); |     |
|     |        | for (int                      | i         | = 0; | i < size(); |     | i++) | {        |     |
System.out.println(getCard(i));
}
System.out.println();
}
}
LikeDeck, theHandclassextendsCardCollection. Soitinheritsmethodslike
getLabel, size, and getCard, which are used in display. Hand also provides
| a constructor, |     | which | invokes | the | constructor |     | of  | CardCollection. |     |
| -------------- | --- | ----- | ------- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --------------- | --- |
In summary, a Deck is just like a CardCollection, but it provides a different
constructor. And a Hand is just like a CardCollection, but it provides an
| additional |         | method, | display. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| 14.3       | Dealing |         | Cards    |     |     |     |     |     |     |
To begin the game, we need to deal cards to each of the players. And during
the game, we need to move cards between hands and piles. If we add the
following method to CardCollection, it can meet both of these requirements:
| public |     | void deal(CardCollection |        |            |         | that, |     | int n) { |     |
| ------ | --- | ------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------- | ----- | --- | -------- | --- |
|        | for | (int                     | i = 0; | i <        | n; i++) | {     |     |          |     |
|        |     | Card                     | card = | popCard(); |         |       |     |          |     |
that.addCard(card);
}
}

| 14.3 Dealing | Cards |     |     | 241 |
| ------------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
The deal method removes cards from the collection it is invoked on, this,
and adds them to the collection it gets as a parameter, that. The second
parameter, n, is the number of cards to deal. We will use this method to
implement dealAll, which deals (or moves) all of the remaining cards:
| public void | dealAll(CardCollection |     | that) { |     |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --- | ------- | --- |
| int n       | = cards.size();        |     |         |     |
| deal(that,  | n);                    |     |         |     |
}
At this point, we can create a Deck and start dealing cards. Here’s a simple
example that deals five cards to a hand, and deals the rest into a draw pile:
| Deck deck | = new Deck("Deck"); |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
deck.shuffle();
| Hand hand       | = new Hand("Hand"); |     |     |     |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| deck.deal(hand, | 5);                 |     |     |     |
hand.display();
| Hand drawPile | = new Hand("Draw |     | Pile"); |     |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --- | ------- | --- |
deck.dealAll(drawPile);
| System.out.printf("Draw |     | Pile has | %d cards.\n", |     |
| ----------------------- | --- | -------- | ------------- | --- |
drawPile.size());
Because the deck is shuffled randomly, you should get a different hand each
time you run this example. The output will look something like this:
Hand:
5 of Diamonds
| Ace of Hearts |     |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
6 of Clubs
6 of Diamonds
2 of Clubs
| Draw Pile | has 47 cards. |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
If you are a careful reader, you might notice something strange about this
example. Take another look at the definition of deal. Notice that the first
parameter is supposed to be a CardCollection. But we invoked it like this:

| 242             |            |               | Chapter | 14 Extending | Classes |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Hand            | hand = new | Hand("Hand"); |         |              |         |
| deck.deal(hand, |            | 5);           |         |              |         |
The argument is a Hand, not a CardCollection. So why is this example legal?
It’sbecauseHandisasubclassofCardCollection, soaHandobjectisalsocon-
sideredtobeaCardCollectionobject. IfamethodexpectsaCardCollection,
| you can | give it a Hand, | a Deck, | or a CardCollection. |     |     |
| ------- | --------------- | ------- | -------------------- | --- | --- |
But it doesn’t work the other way around: not every CardCollection is
a Hand, so if a method expects a Hand, you have to give it a Hand, not a
| CardCollection | or  | a Deck. |     |     |     |
| -------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
If it seems strange that an object can belong to more than one type, remember
that this happens in real life too. Every cat is also a mammal, and every
mammal is also an animal. But not every animal is a mammal, and not every
| mammal | is a cat.  |       |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| 14.4   | The Player | Class |     |     |     |
The Deck and Hand classes we have defined so far could be used for any card
game; we have not yet implemented any of the rules specific to Crazy Eights.
And that’s probably a good thing, since it makes it easy to reuse these classes
| if we want | to make | another game | in the future. |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ | -------------- | --- | --- |
But now it’s time to implement the rules. We’ll use two classes: Player,
which encapsulates player strategy, and Eights, which creates and maintains
the state of the game. Here is the beginning of the Player definition:
| public | class Player         | {       |             |     |     |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
|        | private String       | name;   |             |     |     |
|        | private Hand         | hand;   |             |     |     |
|        | public Player(String |         | name) {     |     |     |
|        | this.name            | = name; |             |     |     |
|        | this.hand            | = new   | Hand(name); |     |     |
}

| 14.4 | The | Player |     | Class |     |     |     | 243 |
| ---- | --- | ------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A Player has two private attributes: a name and a hand. The constructor
takes the player’s name as a string and saves it in an instance variable. In this
example, we have to use this to distinguish between the instance variable and
| the | parameter |     | with | the same | name. |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | ---- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
The primary method that Player provides is play, which decides which card
| to discard |      | during | each        | turn:                 |         |      |         |     |
| ---------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------- | ------- | ---- | ------- | --- |
| public     |      | Card   | play(Eights |                       | eights, | Card | prev) { |     |
|            | Card | card   | =           | searchForMatch(prev); |         |      |         |     |
|            | if   | (card  | ==          | null)                 | {       |      |         |     |
|            |      | card   | =           | drawForMatch(eights,  |         |      | prev);  |     |
}
|     | return |     | card; |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
The first parameter is a reference to the Eights object that encapsulates the
state of the game (coming up in the next section). The second parameter,
| prev, | is the | card | on  | top of | the discard | pile. |     |     |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | --- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | --- | --- |
play invokes two helper methods: searchForMatch and drawForMatch. Since
we have not written them yet, this is an example of top-down design.
Here’s searchForMatch, which looks in the player’s hand for a card that
| matches |     | the previously |                     | played | card:            |        |        |     |
| ------- | --- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | --- |
| public  |     | Card           | searchForMatch(Card |        |                  | prev)  | {      |     |
|         | for | (int           | i                   | = 0;   | i < hand.size(); |        | i++) { |     |
|         |     | Card           | card                | =      | hand.getCard(i); |        |        |     |
|         |     | if             | (cardMatches(card,  |        |                  | prev)) | {      |     |
|         |     |                | return              |        | hand.popCard(i); |        |        |     |
}
}
|     | return |     | null; |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
The strategy is pretty simple: the for loop searches for the first card that’s
legal to play and returns it. If there are no cards that match, it returns null.
In that case, we have to draw cards until we get a match, which is what
| drawForMatch |     |     | does: |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------ | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 244    |                         |                     |                    |     | Chapter | 14    | Extending  | Classes |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | ------- |
| public | Card                    | drawForMatch(Eights |                    |     | eights, | Card  | prev)      | {       |
|        | while                   | (true) {            |                    |     |         |       |            |         |
|        | Card                    | card =              | eights.drawCard(); |     |         |       |            |         |
|        | System.out.println(name |                     |                    |     | + "     | draws | " + card); |         |
|        | if                      | (cardMatches(card,  |                    |     | prev))  | {     |            |         |
|        |                         | return              | card;              |     |         |       |            |         |
}
hand.addCard(card);
}
}
The while loop runs until it finds a match (we’ll assume for now that it always
finds one). The loop uses the Eights object to draw a card. If it matches,
drawForMatch returns the card. Otherwise it adds the card to the player’s
| hand and | repeats. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Both searchForMatch and drawForMatch use cardMatches, which is a static
method, also defined in Player. This method is a straightforward translation
| of the | rules of | the game:       |                  |     |                 |        |      |          |
| ------ | -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --- | --------------- | ------ | ---- | -------- |
| public | static   | boolean         | cardMatches(Card |     |                 | card1, | Card | card2) { |
|        | return   | card1.getSuit() |                  | ==  | card2.getSuit() |        |      |          |
|        | ||       | card1.getRank() |                  | ==  | card2.getRank() |        |      |          |
|        | ||       | card1.getRank() |                  | ==  | 8;              |        |      |          |
}
Finally, Player provides a score method, which computes penalty points for
| cards left | in a | player’s hand | at the | end | of the | game. |     |     |

| 14.5       | The  | Eights        | Class  |     |        |       |     |     |
In Section ??, we introduced top-down design. In this way of developing pro-
grams, we identify high-level goals, like shuffling a deck, and break them into
smaller problems, like choosing a random element or swapping two elements.
In this section, we present bottom-up design, which goes the other way
around: first we identify simple pieces we need and then we assemble them
| into more-complex |     | algorithms. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------------- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 14.5 | The | Eights | Class |     |     |     |     | 245 |
| ---- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Looking at the rules of Crazy Eights, we can identify some of the methods
we’ll need:
• Create the deck, the players, and the discard and draw piles. Deal the
|     | cards   | and set | up  | the game. | (Eights  | constructor) |     |     |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
|     | • Check | whether | the | game      | is over. | (isDone)     |     |     |
• If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and move the cards into
|     | the | draw pile. | (reshuffle) |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• Draw a card, reshuffling the discard pile if necessary. (drawCard)
• Keep track of whose turn it is, and switch from one player to the next.
(nextPlayer)
• Display the state of the game, and wait for the user before running the
|     | next | turn. (displayState) |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | -------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Now we can start implementing the pieces. Here is the beginning of the class
| definition |         | for Eights, | which   |              | encapsulates | the state | of the game: |     |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ------------ | --- |
|            | public  | class       | Eights  | {            |              |           |              |     |
|            | private |             | Player  | one;         |              |           |              |     |
|            | private |             | Player  | two;         |              |           |              |     |
|            | private |             | Hand    | drawPile;    |              |           |              |     |
|            | private |             | Hand    | discardPile; |              |           |              |     |
|            | private |             | Scanner | in;          |              |           |              |     |
In this version, there are always two players. One of the exercises at the end of
the chapter asks you to modify this code to handle more players. The Eights
class also includes a draw pile, a discard pile, and a Scanner, which we will
| use | to prompt | the | user | after | each turn. |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | ---- | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
The constructor for Eights initializes the instance variables and deals the
cards, similar to Section ??. The next piece we’ll need is a method that checks
| whether |        | the game                | is over. | If  | either hand | is empty,                   | we’re done: |     |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------------- | -------- | --- | ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
|         | public | boolean                 | isDone() |     | {           |                             |             |     |
|         | return | one.getHand().isEmpty() |          |     |             | || two.getHand().isEmpty(); |             |     |
}

| 246 |     |     | Chapter | 14 Extending | Classes |
| --- | --- | --- | ------- | ------------ | ------- |
When the draw pile is empty, we have to shuffle the discard pile. Here is a
| method | for that:        |                          |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ | --- | --- | --- |
| public | void reshuffle() | {                        |     |     |     |
|        | Card prev        | = discardPile.popCard(); |     |     |     |
discardPile.dealAll(drawPile);
discardPile.addCard(prev);
drawPile.shuffle();
}
The first line saves the top card from discardPile. The next line transfers
the rest of the cards to drawPile. Then we put the saved card back into
discardPile and shuffle drawPile. We can use reshuffle as part of the
draw method:
| public | Card drawCard()         | {   |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | if (drawPile.isEmpty()) | {   |     |     |     |
reshuffle();
}
|     | return drawPile.popCard(); |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
The nextPlayer method takes the current player as a parameter and returns
| the player | who should  | go next:          |          |     |     |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------- | --- | --- |
| public     | Player      | nextPlayer(Player | current) | {   |     |
|            | if (current | == one) {         |          |     |     |
|            | return      | two;              |          |     |     |
|            | } else {    |                   |          |     |     |
|            | return      | one;              |          |     |     |
}
}
The last method from our bottom-up design is displayState. It displays the
hand of each player, the contents of the discard pile, and the number of cards
in the draw pile. Finally, it waits for the user to press the Enter key:

| 14.5   | The | Eights | Class          |     |     |     |     |     | 247 |
| ------ | --- | ------ | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public |     | void   | displayState() |     | {   |     |     |     |     |
one.display();
two.display();
discardPile.display();
|     | System.out.println("Draw           |     |     |     | pile:"); |     |              |     |     |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- |
|     | System.out.println(drawPile.size() |     |     |     |          |     | + " cards"); |     |     |
in.nextLine();
}
Using these pieces, we can write takeTurn, which executes one player’s turn.
It reads the top card off the discard pile and passes it to player.play, which
you saw in the previous section. The result is the card the player chose, which
| is added |      | to the discard |                           | pile: |         |        |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| public   |      | void           | takeTurn(Player           |       | player) | {      |     |     |     |
|          | Card | prev           | = discardPile.lastCard(); |       |         |        |     |     |     |
|          | Card | next           | = player.play(this,       |       |         | prev); |     |     |     |
discardPile.addCard(next);
|     | System.out.println(player.getName() |     |     |     |     |     | + " plays | " + next); |     |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------- | ---------- | --- |
System.out.println();
}
Finally, we use takeTurn and the other methods to write playGame:
| public |        | void        | playGame() |        | {       |          |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | Player |             | player     | = one; |         |          |     |     |     |
|        | //     | keep        | playing    | until  | there's | a winner |     |     |     |
|        | while  | (!isDone()) |            |        | {       |          |     |     |     |
displayState();
takeTurn(player);
|     |     | player | =   | nextPlayer(player); |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------ | --- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
|     | //  | display | the | final | score |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------- | --- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
one.displayScore();
two.displayScore();
}

| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ------------ | ------- |
Done! The result of bottom-up design is similar to top-down: we have a high-
level method that calls helper methods. The difference is the development
| process | we used to | arrive at     | this solution. |     |     |     |

| 14.6    | Class      | Relationships |                |     |     |     |
This chapter demonstrates two common relationships between classes:
composition: Instancesofoneclasscontainreferencestoinstancesofanother
class. For example, an instance of Eights contains references to two
| Player | objects, | two Hand | objects, | and a Scanner. |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- | --- | --- |
inheritance: One class extends another class. For example, Hand extends
CardCollection, so every instance of Hand is also a CardCollection.
Composition is also known as a relationship, as in “Eights has a
HAS-A
Scanner”. Inheritance is also known as an relationship, as in “Hand is a
IS-A
CardCollection”. This vocabulary provides a concise way to talk about an
| object-oriented | design. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
There is also a standard way to represent these relationships graphically in
UML class diagrams. As you saw in Section ??, the UML representation of
a class is a box with three sections: the class name, the attributes, and the
methods. The latter two sections are optional when showing relationships.

minimize the number of classes. As a result, we ended up with a few awkward
methods. For example, cardMatches is a static method in Player, but it

The problem is that Card is supposed to be useful for any card game, not just
Crazy Eights. You can solve this problem by adding a new class, EightsCard,
that extends Card and provides a method, match, that checks whether two
| cards | match according | to the rules | of Crazy Eights. |     |     |

Hand and provides a method, scoreHand, that adds up the scores of the cards

Chapter 15
Arrays of Arrays
The last three chapters of this book use 2D graphics to illustrate more ad-
vanced object-oriented concepts. If you haven’t yet read Appendix ??, you
might want to read it now and become familiar with the Canvas, Color, and
Graphics classes from the java.awt package. In this chapter, we use these
classes to draw images and animations, and to run graphical simulations.
15.1 Conway’s Game of Life
The Game of Life, or GoL for short, was developed by John Conway and pop-
ularized in 1970 in Martin Gardner’s column in Scientific American. Conway
calls it a “zero-player game” because no players are needed to choose strategies
or make decisions. After you set up the initial conditions, you watch the game
play itself. That turns out to be more interesting than it sounds; you can read
about it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway’s_Game_of_Life.
The game board is a 2D grid of square cells. Each cell is either “alive” or
“dead”; the color of the cell indicates its state. Figure ?? shows an example
grid configuration; the five black cells are alive.
The game proceeds in time steps, during which each cell interacts with its
neighbors in the eight adjacent cells. At each time step, the following rules
are applied:

| 252 |        |       |            | Chapter     | 15 Arrays | of Arrays |
| --- | ------ | ----- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- |
|     | Figure | 15.1: | A “Glider” | in the Game | of Life.  |           |
• A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
• A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
• A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
reproduction.
Notice some consequences of these rules. If you start with a single live cell, it
dies. If all cells are dead, no cells come to life. But if you have four cells in a
square, they keep each other alive, so that’s a “stable” configuration.
Another initial configuration is shown in Figure ??. If you start with three
horizontal cells, the center cell lives, the left and right cells die, and the top
and bottom cells come to life. The result after the first time step is three
| vertical | cells. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
During the next time step, the center cell lives, the top and bottom cells die,
and the left and right cells come to life. The result is three horizontal cells, so
| we’re back | where  | we started, | and the     | cycle repeats | forever.      |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --- |
|            | Figure | 15.2:       | A “Blinker” | in the        | Game of Life. |     |
Patterns like this are called “periodic”, because they repeat after a period of
two or more time steps. But they are also considered stable, because the total
| number | of live cells | doesn’t | grow over | time. |     |     |
| ------ | ------------- | ------- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- |

| 15.2 | The Cell | Class |     |     |     |     | 253 |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Most simple starting configurations either die out quickly or reach a stable
configuration. But there are a few starting conditions that display remarkable
complexity. One of those is the R-pentomino (https://www.conwaylife.
com/wiki/R-pentomino), which starts with only five cells, runs for 1,103 time
| steps, | and ends in | a stable | configuration | with | 116 live | cells. |     |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ---- | -------- | ------ | --- |
In the following sections, we’ll implement the Game of Life in Java. We’ll first
implement the cells, then the grid of cells, and finally the game itself.
| 15.2 | The | Cell Class |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
When drawing a cell, we’ll need to know its location on the screen and size
in pixels. To represent the location, we use the x and y coordinates of the
upper-left corner. And to represent the size, we use an integer, size.
To represent the state of a cell, we use an integer, state, which is 0 for dead
cellsand1forlivecells. Wecoulduseabooleaninstead, butit’sgoodpractice
to design classes to be reusable (e.g., for other games that have more states).
| Here is | a Cell class | that declares | these | instance | variables: |     |     |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| public  | class        | Cell {        |       |          |            |     |     |
|         | private      | final int     | x;    |          |            |     |     |
|         | private      | final int     | y;    |          |            |     |     |
|         | private      | final int     | size; |          |            |     |     |
|         | private      | int state;    |       |          |            |     |     |
}
Notice that x, y, and size are constants. Once the cell is created, we don’t
want it to move or change size. But state can and should change, so it is not
a constant.
The next step is to write a constructor. Here’s one that takes x, y, and size
| as parameters, | and        | sets state | to a default |       | value: |     |     |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----- | ------ | --- | --- |
| public         | Cell(int   | x, int     | y, int       | size) | {      |     |     |
|                | this.x =   | x;         |              |       |        |     |     |
|                | this.y =   | y;         |              |       |        |     |     |
|                | this.size  | = size;    |              |       |        |     |     |
|                | this.state | = 0;       |              |       |        |     |     |
}

The following method draws a cell. Like the paint method in Appendix ??,
| it takes | a graphics |     | context | as a | parameter: |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | ------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
public static final Color[] COLORS = {Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK};
| public | void | draw(Graphics |     |     | g) { |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---- | ------------- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
g.setColor(COLORS[state]);
|     | g.fillRect(x |     | +   | 1, y | + 1, size |     | - 1, | size | - 1); |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --- | ---- | --------- | --- | ---- | ---- | ----- | --- |
g.setColor(Color.LIGHT_GRAY);
|     | g.drawRect(x, |     |     | y, size, | size); |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------------- | --- | --- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
The draw method uses the state of the cell to select a color from an array of
Color objects. Then it uses to fillRect to draw the center of the cell and
| drawRect | to draw | a   | light-gray |     | border. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
We also need methods to get and set the cell’s state. We could just provide
getState and setState, but the code will be more readable if we provide
| methods | customized |       | for     | the Game | of Life: |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public  | boolean    |       | isOff() |          | {        |     |     |     |     |     |
|         | return     | state | ==      | 0;       |          |     |     |     |     |     |
}
| public | boolean |       | isOn() | {   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return  | state | ==     | 1;  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
}
| public | void  | turnOff() |     | {   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | state | = 0;      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
}
| public | void  | turnOn() |     | {   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | state | = 1;     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
}
| 15.3 | Two-Dimensional |     |     |     |     | Arrays |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To represent a grid of cells, we can use a multidimensional array. To create
| a 2D | array, we | specify | the | number | of rows | and | columns: |     |     |     |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | --- | ------ | ------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |

| 15.3     | Two-Dimensional |       |       | Arrays            |     |     |     |     | 255 |
| -------- | --------------- | ----- | ----- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| int      | rows            | = 4;  |       |                   |     |     |     |     |     |
| int      | cols            | = 3;  |       |                   |     |     |     |     |     |
| Cell[][] |                 | array | = new | Cell[rows][cols]; |     |     |     |     |     |
The result is an array with four rows and three columns. Initially, the elements
of the array are null. We can fill the array with Cell objects like this:
| for | (int | r = 0;      | r <     | rows;     | r++)    | {   |        |     |     |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- |
|     | int  | y = r       | * size; |           |         |     |        |     |     |
|     | for  | (int c      | = 0;    | c < cols; | c++)    | {   |        |     |     |
|     |      | int x       | = c *   | size;     |         |     |        |     |     |
|     |      | array[r][c] |         | = new     | Cell(x, | y,  | size); |     |     |
}
}
The loop variables r and c are the row and column indexes of the cells. The
variables x and y are the coordinates, respectively. For example, if size is 10
pixels, the cell at index (1, 2) would be at coordinates (10, 20) on the screen.
In Java, a 2D array is really an array of arrays. You can think of it as an array
of rows, where each row is an array. Figure ?? shows what it looks like.

|     |     | Figure 15.3: | Storing | rows | and | columns | with a | 2D array. |     |
When we write array[r][c], Java uses the first index to select a row and the
second index to select an element from the row. This way of representing 2D
| data | is known | as row-major |     | order. |     |     |     |     |     |

Now that we have a Cell class and a way to represent a 2D array of cells, we
can write a class to represent a grid of cells. We encapsulate the code from
the previous section and generalize it to construct a grid with any number of
| rows   | and columns: |                |             |                   |           |         |         |     |        |     |

|        |              |                | int         | x =               | c * size; |         |         |     |        |     |

}
}
|     | //           | set | the | canvas | size  |      |          |     |     |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --- | ------ | ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |

}
Using vocabulary from the previous chapter, GridCanvas “is a” Canvas that
“has a” 2D array of cells. By extending the Canvas class from java.awt, we
| inherit | methods | for | drawing | graphics |     | on the | screen. |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- | ------- | -------- | --- | ------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
In fact, the code is surprisingly straightforward: to draw the grid, we simply
draw each cell. We use nested for loops to traverse the 2D array:
| public | void        | draw(Graphics |     |          | g)     | {   |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- | --- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | for (Cell[] |               | row | : array) |        | {   |     |     |     |     |
|        | for         | (Cell         |     | cell     | : row) | {   |     |     |     |     |
cell.draw(g);
}
}
}

| 15.5 | Other | Grid Methods |     |     |     | 257 |
| ---- | ----- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The outer loop traverses the rows; the inner loop traverses the cells in each
row. You can almost read this method in English: “For each row in the array,
and for each cell in the row, draw the cell in the graphics context.” Each
cell contains its coordinates and size, so it knows how to draw itself.
Classes that extend Canvas are supposed to provide a method called paint
that “paints” the contents of the Canvas. It gets invoked when the Canvas is
created and anytime it needs to be redrawn; for example, when its window is
| moved | or resized. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Here’s the paint method for GridCanvas. When the window management
| system | calls | paint, paint   | calls | draw, which draws | the cells: |     |
| ------ | ----- | -------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ---------- | --- |
| public | void  | paint(Graphics |       | g) {              |            |     |
draw(g);
}
| 15.5 | Other | Grid | Methods |     |     |     |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
In addition to draw and paint, the GridCanvas class provides methods for
working with the grid itself. numRows and numCols return the number of rows
and columns. We can get this information from the 2D array, using length:
| public | int    | numRows()     | {   |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return | array.length; |     |     |     |     |
}
| public | int    | numCols()        | {   |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | return | array[0].length; |     |     |     |     |
}
Because we are using row-major order, the 2D array is an array of rows.
numRows simply returns the length of the rows array. numCols returns the
length of the first row, which is the number of columns. Since the rows all
| have the | same | length, | we have to | check only one. |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ---------- | --------------- | --- | --- |
GridCanvas also provides a method that gets the Cell at a given location,
and for convenience when starting the game, a method that turns on the Cell
| at a given | location. |     |     |     |     |     |

|        | return | array[r][c]; |     |        |         |           |           |
}
| public | void | turnOn(int |     | r, int | c) { |     |     |

array[r][c].turnOn();
}
| 15.6 | Starting |     | the | Game |     |     |     |
| ---- | -------- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
Now we’re ready to implement the game. To encapsulate the rules of GoL,
we define a class named Conway. The Conway class “has a” GridCanvas that
| represents | the | state | of the | game. |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ----- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
This constructor makes a GridCanvas with 5 rows and 10 columns, with cells
that are 20 pixels wide and high. It then sets up the initial conditions:
| public | class          | Conway     |                   | {     |          |     |     |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
|        | private        | GridCanvas |                   | grid; |          |     |     |
|        | public         | Conway()   |                   | {     |          |     |     |
|        | grid           | =          | new GridCanvas(5, |       | 10, 20); |     |     |
|        | grid.turnOn(2, |            |                   | 1);   |          |     |     |
|        | grid.turnOn(2, |            |                   | 2);   |          |     |     |
|        | grid.turnOn(2, |            |                   | 3);   |          |     |     |
|        | grid.turnOn(1, |            |                   | 7);   |          |     |     |
|        | grid.turnOn(2, |            |                   | 7);   |          |     |     |
|        | grid.turnOn(3, |            |                   | 7);   |          |     |     |
}
}
Before we implement the rest of the game, we’ll write a main method that
creates a Conway object and displays it. We can use this method to test Cell
| and GridCanvas, |     | and | to develop | the other | methods | we need: |     |
| --------------- | --- | --- | ---------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | --- |

| ------ | ------ | ---------- | ----- | -------------------- | ---- | ----- | --------- | --- |
| public |        | static     | void  | main(String[]        |      | args) | {         |     |
|        | String |            | title | = "Conway's          | Game |       | of Life"; |     |
|        | Conway |            | game  | = new Conway();      |      |       |           |     |
|        | JFrame |            | frame | = new JFrame(title); |      |       |           |     |
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
frame.setResizable(false);
frame.add(game.grid);
frame.pack();
frame.setVisible(true);
game.mainloop();
}
After constructing the game object, main constructs a JFrame, which creates
a window on the screen. The JFrame is configured1 to exit the program when
| closed. | Resizing |     | the window | is  | disabled. |     |     |     |
| ------- | -------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
main then adds the GridCanvas inside the frame, resizes (“packs”) the frame
to fit the canvas, and makes the frame visible. Figure ?? shows the result.
|      |     | Figure | 15.4:      | Screenshot | of the | initial | Conway application. |     |

At the end of main, we call mainloop, which uses a while loop to simulate
the time steps of the Game of Life. Here’s a rough draft of this method:
1We are using JFrame (in javax.swing) instead of Frame (in java.awt) for simplicity.
Frame does not provide a default close operation; it requires you to implement a method to
| be called | when | the | user closes | the window. |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---- | --- | ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 260     |       |                 |     |     | Chapter | 15 Arrays | of Arrays |
| ------- | ----- | --------------- | --- | --- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| private |       | void mainloop() |     | {   |         |           |           |
|         | while | (true)          | {   |     |         |           |           |
this.update();
grid.repaint();
|     |     | Thread.sleep(500); |     |     | // compiler | error |     |
| --- | --- | ------------------ | --- | --- | ----------- | ----- | --- |
}
}
During each time step, we update the state of the game and repaint the grid.
| We will | present | the | update | method | in Section ??. |     |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- | ------ | ------ | -------------- | --- | --- |
repaint comes from the Canvas class. By default, it calls the paint method
we provided, which calls draw. The reason we use it here is that repaint does
| not require | a   | Graphics | object | as a | parameter. |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ---- | ---------- | --- | --- |
Thread.sleep(500) causes the program to “sleep” for 500 milliseconds, or a
half second. Otherwise, the program would run so fast we would not be able
| to see | the animation. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
There’s just one problem: compiling this code results in the error “unreported
exception InterruptedException”. This message means we need to do some
| exception | handling. |     |          |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15.8      | Exception |     | Handling |     |     |     |     |
So far, the only exceptions you have seen are run-time errors like “array index
out of bounds” and “null pointer”. When one of these exceptions occurs, Java
| displays | a message | and | ends | the program. |     |     |     |
| -------- | --------- | --- | ---- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
If you don’t want the program to end, you can handle exceptions with a try-
catch statement. The syntax is similar to an if-else statement, and the logic
| is, too. | Here’s | what | it looks | like: |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | ---- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
try {
Thread.sleep(500);
| } catch |       | (InterruptedException |     |     | e) { |     |     |
| ------- | ----- | --------------------- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
|         | // do | nothing               |     |     |      |     |     |
}

| 15.9 | Counting | Neighbors |     |     |     | 261 |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
First, Java runs the code in the try block, which calls Thread.sleep in this
example. If an InterruptedException occurs during the try block, Java
executesthecatchblock. Inthisexample, thecatchblockcontainsacomment,
| so it doesn’t | do  | anything. |     |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Ifadifferentexceptionoccursduringthetryblock,Javadoeswhateveritwould
do otherwise, which is probably to display a message and end the program. If
no exceptions occur during the try block, the catch block doesn’t run and the
| program | continues. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In this example, the effect of the try-catch statement is to ignore an “inter-
rupted” exception if it occurs. As an alternative, we could use the catch block
to display a customized message, end the program, or handle the exception in
whatever way is appropriate. For example, if user input causes an exception,
we could catch the exception and prompt the user to try again later.
There’s more to learn about exception handling. You can read about excep-
tions in the Java tutorials (see https://thinkjava.org/exceptions).
| 15.9 | Counting |     | Neighbors |     |     |     |
| ---- | -------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
Now that you know about try and catch, we can use them to implement a
useful method in GridCanvas. Part of the GoL logic is to count the number
of live neighbors. Most cells have eight neighbors, as shown in Figure ??.
However, cells on the edges and in the corners have fewer neighbors. If we try
to count all possible neighbors, we’ll go out of bounds. The following method
| uses a | try-catch | statement            | to deal | with these special | cases: |     |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | ------ | --- |
| public | int       | test(int             | r, int  | c) {               |        |     |
|        | try {     |                      |         |                    |        |     |
|        | if        | (array[r][c].isOn()) |         | {                  |        |     |
|        |           | return               | 1;      |                    |        |     |
}
|     | } catch | (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException |               |     | e) { |     |
| --- | ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | --- | ---- | --- |
|     | //      | cell                            | doesn't exist |     |      |     |
}
|     | return | 0;  |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}

| 262 |     |     |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 15 Arrays | of Arrays |

Figure 15.5: Cells in the interior of the grid have eight neighbors. Cells in the
| corners | and | along | the edges | have | fewer | neighbors. |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ----- | --------- | ---- | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
The test method takes a row index, r, and a column index, c. It tries to look
up the Cell at that location. If both indexes are in bounds, the Cell exists.
In that case, test returns 1 if the Cell is on. Otherwise, it skips the catch
| block | and | returns | 0.  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
If either index is out of bounds, the array lookup throws an exception, but the
catch block ignores it. Then test resumes and returns 0. So the non-existent
| cells | around | the | perimeter | are | considered | to  | be off. |     |     |
| ----- | ------ | --- | --------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
Now we can use test to implement countAlive, which takes a grid location,
(r, c), and returns the number of live neighbors surrounding that location:
| private |        | int   | countAlive(int  |     | r,   | int | c) { |     |     |
| ------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
|         | int    | count | = 0;            |     |      |     |      |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r  |     | - 1, | c - | 1);  |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r  |     | - 1, | c); |      |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r  |     | - 1, | c + | 1);  |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r, |     | c -  | 1); |      |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r, |     | c +  | 1); |      |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r  |     | + 1, | c - | 1);  |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r  |     | + 1, | c); |      |     |     |
|         | count  |       | += grid.test(r  |     | + 1, | c + | 1);  |     |     |
|         | return |       | count;          |     |      |     |      |     |     |
}
Because test handles “out of bounds” exceptions, countAlive works for any
| values | of  | r and | c.  |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| 15.10 |          | Updating |     | the  |     | Grid |     |     |     |
Now we are ready to write update, which gets invoked each time through the
simulation loop. It uses the GoL rules to compute the state of the grid after
| the    | next    | time step: |          |                     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public |         | void       | update() | {                   |     |     |     |     |     |
|        | int[][] |            | counts   | = countNeighbors(); |     |     |     |     |     |
updateGrid(counts);
}
The rules of GoL specify that you have to update the cells “simultaneously”;
that is, you have to count the neighbors for all cells before you can update any
of them.
We do that by traversing the grid twice: first, countNeighbors counts the live
neighbors for each cell and puts the results in an array named counts; second,
| updateGrid |         | updates | the               | cells.           | Here’s           | countNeighbors: |      |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| private    |         | int[][] |                   | countNeighbors() |                  |                 | {    |     |     |
|            | int     | rows    | = grid.numRows(); |                  |                  |                 |      |     |     |

|            | int[][] |         | counts            | = new            | int[rows][cols]; |                 |      |     |     |
|            | for     | (int    | r =               | 0; r             | < rows;          | r++)            | {    |     |     |
|            |         | for     | (int              | c = 0;           | c <              | cols;           | c++) | {   |     |
|            |         |         | counts[r][c]      |                  | =                | countAlive(r,   |      | c); |     |
}
}
|     | return |     | counts; |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
countNeighbors traverses the cells in the grid and uses countAlive from the
previous section to count the neighbors. The return value is a 2D array of
integers with the same size as grid. Figure illustrates an example.
??
IncontrasttothedrawmethodofGridCanvas, whichusesenhancedforloops,
countNeighbors uses standard for loops. The reason is that, in this example,
| we need | the | indexes | r   | and c | to store | the | neighbor | counts. |     |

updateGrid uses getCell to select each Cell in the grid, and updateCell to
do the update:
| private | void     | updateGrid(int[][] |                 |                   | counts)        |      | {   |     |     |

|         | int cols | =                  | grid.numCols(); |                   |                |      |     |     |     |
|         | for (int | r                  | = 0;            | r < rows;         | r++)           | {    |     |     |     |
|         | for      | (int               | c               | = 0; c <          | cols;          | c++) | {   |     |     |
|         |          | Cell               | cell            | = grid.getCell(r, |                |      | c); |     |     |
|         |          | updateCell(cell,   |                 |                   | counts[r][c]); |      |     |     |     |
}
}
}
updateCell implements the GoL rules: if the cell is alive, it dies if it has fewer
than two or more than three neighbors; if the cell is dead, it comes to life if it
| has     | exactly three:   |        |      |                 |     |       |     |        |     |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------ | ---- | --------------- | --- | ----- | --- | ------ | --- |
| private | static           |        | void | updateCell(Cell |     | cell, | int | count) | {   |
|         | if (cell.isOn()) |        |      | {               |     |       |     |        |     |
|         | if               | (count | <    | 2 || count      | >   | 3) {  |     |        |     |
cell.turnOff();
}
|     | } else | {      |     |      |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------ | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | if     | (count | ==  | 3) { |     |     |     |     |     |
cell.turnOn();
}
}
}
Notice that updateGrid and updateCell are both private, because they are

Now our implementation of the Game of Life is complete. We think it’s is
pretty fun, and we hope you agree. But more importantly, this example is
meant to demonstrate the use of 2D arrays and an object-oriented design
| that’s a         | little | more         | substantial |          | than  | in previous | chapters. |            |     |      |

Exercise 15.2 In our version of the Game of Life, the grid has a finite size.
As a result, moving objects such as Gliders either crash into the wall or go out
of bounds.
An interesting variation of the Game of Life is a “toroidal” grid, meaning that
the cells “wrap around” on the edges. Modify the test method of GridCanvas
so that the coordinates r and c map to the opposite side of the grid if they
| are too | low | or two | high. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Run your code with a Glider (see Figure ??) to see if it works. You can
initialize the Glider by modifying the constructor in the Conway class, or by
| reading | it from | a   | file (see | the | next | exercise). |     |     |     |     |

Exercise 15.3 The LifeWiki site (https://conwaylife.com/wiki/) has a
fascinating collection of patterns for the Game of Life. These patterns are
stored in a file format that is easy to read, in files with the suffix “.cells”.
For example, here is an 8 x 10 grid with a Glider near the upper-left corner:
|     | !Name: | Glider |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
..........
..O.......
...O......
.OOO......
..........
..........
..........
..........
Lines that begin with ! are comments and should be ignored. The rest of
the file describes the grid, row by row. A period represents a dead cell, and
an uppercase O represents a live cell. See https://conwaylife.com/wiki/
| Plaintext |     | for more | examples. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | -------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
1. Create a plain text file with the contents shown above, and save the file
|     | as  |     | in  | the same | directory |     | as your | code. |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | --------- | --- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- |
glider.cells
2. Define a constructor for the Conway class that takes a string representing
|     | the name | (or     | path)         | of   | a “.cells”      | file.          | Here is | a starting | point: |     |
| --- | -------- | ------- | ------------- | ---- | --------------- | -------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ | --- |
|     | public   |         | Conway(String |      |                 | path)          | {       |            |        |     |
|     |          | File    | file          | =    | new File(path); |                |         |            |        |     |
|     |          | Scanner |               | scan | = new           | Scanner(file); |         |            |        |     |
}
|     | 3. Modify | the | main | method | to                      | invoke | the constructor |     | as follows: |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ----------------------- | ------ | --------------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
|     | Conway    |     | game | = new  | Conway("glider.cells"); |        |                 |     |             |     |
4. Handle the FileNotFoundException that may be thrown when creating
a Scanner for a File by invoking printStackTrace on the exception
object and calling System.exit() with a status of 1, indicating an error.
5. Continueimplementingtheconstructorbyreadingallnon-commentlines
into an ArrayList via hasNextLine and nextLine of the Scanner.

6. Determine the number of rows and columns of the grid by examining the
|     | ArrayList |     | contents.  |              |     |          |                |
| --- | --------- | --- | ---------- | ------------ | --- | -------- | -------------- |
|     | 7. Create | and | initialize | a GridCanvas |     | based on | the ArrayList. |
Once your constructor is working, you will be able to run many of the patterns
on the LifeWiki. You might want to add a margin of empty cells around the
| initial | pattern, |     | to give | it room | to grow. |     |     |
| ------- | -------- | --- | ------- | ------- | -------- | --- | --- |
Exercise 15.4 Some files on the LifeWiki use “run-length encoding” (RLE)
instead of plain text. The basic idea of RLE is to describe the number of dead
| and | alive | cells, | rather | than type | out each | individual | cell. |
| --- | ----- | ------ | ------ | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
For example, from the previous exercise could be represented this
glider.cells
| way | with     | RLE:   |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | #C Name: | Glider |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | x =      | 10, y  | = 8 |     |     |     |     |
$2bo$3bo$b3o!
The first line specifies x (the number of columns) and y (the number of rows).
Subsequent lines consist of the letters b (dead), o (alive), and $ (end of line),
optionally preceded by a count. The pattern ends with !, after which any
| remaining |     | file | contents | are ignored. |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | ---- | -------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
Lines beginning with # have special meaning and are not part of the pattern.
For example, #C is a comment line. You can read more about RLE format on
https://conwaylife.com/wiki/RLE.
1. Create a plain text file with the preceding contents, and save the file as
|     | glider.rle |     | in the | same directory | as  | your code. |     |
| --- | ---------- | --- | ------ | -------------- | --- | ---------- | --- |
2. Modify your constructor from the previous exercise to check the last
three characters of the path. If they are "rle", then you will need to
process the file as RLE. Otherwise, assume the file is in “.cells” format.
3. In the end, your constructor should be able to read and initialize grids
in both formats. Test your constructor by modifying the main method
|     | to  | read different |     | files. |     |     |     |

| Reusing | Classes |     |     |
In Chapter ??, we developed classes to implement Conway’s Game of Life. We
can reuse the Cell and GridCanvas classes to implement other simulations.
One of the most interesting zero-player games is Langton’s Ant, which models
an “ant” that walks around a grid. The ant follows only two simple rules:
1. If the ant is on a white cell, it turns to the right, makes the cell black,
| and | moves forward. |     |     |
| --- | -------------- | --- | --- |
2. If the ant is on a black cell, it turns to the left, makes the cell white, and
| moves | forward. |     |     |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
Becausetherulesaresimple, youmightexpecttheanttodosomethingsimple,
like make a square or repeat a simple pattern. But starting on a grid with
all white cells, the ant makes more than 10,000 steps in a seemingly random
pattern before it settles into a repeating loop of 104 steps. You can read more
| about | it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton’s_ant. |     |     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
In this chapter, we present an implementation of Langton’s Ant and use it to
| demonstrate | more advanced | object-oriented | techniques. |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 16.1        | Langton’s     | Ant             |             |
We begin by defining a Langton class that has a grid and information about
the ant. The constructor takes the grid dimensions as parameters:

| public |         | class | Langton     |                  | {           |     |         |            |        |         |
|        | private |       | GridCanvas  |                  | grid;       |     |         |            |        |         |
|        | private |       | int         | xpos;            |             |     |         |            |        |         |
|        | private |       | int         | ypos;            |             |     |         |            |        |         |
|        | private |       | int         | head;            | // 0=North, |     | 1=East, | 2=South,   | 3=West |         |
|        | public  |       | Langton(int |                  | rows,       | int | cols) { |            |        |         |
|        |         | grid  | = new       | GridCanvas(rows, |             |     | cols,   | 10);       |        |         |
|        |         | xpos  | = rows      | /                | 2;          |     |         |            |        |         |
|        |         | ypos  | = cols      | /                | 2;          |     |         |            |        |         |
|        |         | head  | = 0;        |                  |             |     |         |            |        |         |
}
}
grid is a GridCanvas object, which represents the state of the cells. xpos and
ypos are the coordinates of the ant, and head is the “heading” of the ant; that
is, which direction it is facing. head is an integer with four possible values,
where 0 means the ant is facing “north” (i.e., toward the top of the screen), 1
| means | “east”, | etc. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | ------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Here’s an update method that implements the rules for Langton’s Ant:
| public |     | void | update() |     | {   |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
flipCell();
moveAnt();
}
The flipCell method gets the Cell at the ant’s location, figures out which
| way     | to turn, | and            | changes    | the                | state  | of the | cell:   |       |     |     |
| ------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| private |          | void           | flipCell() |                    | {      |        |         |       |     |     |
|         | Cell     | cell           | =          | grid.getCell(xpos, |        |        | ypos);  |       |     |     |
|         | if       | (cell.isOff()) |            |                    | {      |        |         |       |     |     |
|         |          | head           | = (head    |                    | + 1) % | 4;     | // turn | right |     |     |
cell.turnOn();
|     | }   | else | {       |     |        |     |         |      |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- | ------ | --- | ------- | ---- | --- | --- |
|     |     | head | = (head |     | + 3) % | 4;  | // turn | left |     |     |
cell.turnOff();
}
}

We use the remainder operator, %, to make head wrap around: if head is 3
and we turn right, it wraps around to 0; if head is 0 and we turn left, it wraps
around to 3.
Notice that to turn right, we add 1 to head. To turn left, we could subtract 1,
but -1 % 4 is -1 in Java. So we add 3 instead, since one left turn is the same
| as three right turns. |     |     |     |     |
| --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The moveAnt method moves the ant forward one square, using head to deter-
| mine which way | is forward: |     |     |     |
| -------------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
| private void   | moveAnt()   | {   |     |     |
| if (head       | == 0) {     |     |     |     |
ypos -= 1;
| } else | if (head | == 1) { |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | --- | --- |
xpos += 1;
| } else | if (head | == 2) { |     |     |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | --- | --- |
ypos += 1;
| } else | {   |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
xpos -= 1;
}
}
Here is the main method we use to create and display the Langton object:
| public static | void main(String[] |                | args) { |     |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------- | --- |
| String        | title = "Langton's |                | Ant";   |     |
| Langton       | game = new         | Langton(61,    | 61);    |     |
| JFrame        | frame = new        | JFrame(title); |         |     |
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
frame.setResizable(false);
frame.add(game.grid);
frame.pack();
frame.setVisible(true);
game.mainloop();
}
Most of this code is the same as the main we used to create and run Conway,
in Section ??. It creates and configures a JFrame and runs mainloop.

And that’s everything! If you run this code with a grid size of 61 x 61 or
larger, you will see the ant eventually settle into a repeating pattern.
Because we designed Cell and GridCanvas to be reusable, we didn’t have to
modify them at all. However, we now have two copies of main and mainloop—
| one  | in Conway, |             | and one | in Langton. |     |     |     |     |     |

| 16.2 |            | Refactoring |         |             |     |     |     |     |     |
Whenever you see repeated code like main, you should think about ways to
remove it. In Chapter ??, we used inheritance to eliminate repeated code.
| We’ll | do  | something | similar | with | Conway | and | Langton. |     |     |
| ----- | --- | --------- | ------- | ---- | ------ | --- | -------- | --- | --- |
First, we define a superclass named Automaton, in which we will put the code
| that   | Conway  | and    | Langton         | have | in common:         |     |       |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | --------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| public |         | class  | Automaton       |      | {                  |     |       |     |     |
|        | private |        | GridCanvas      |      | grid;              |     |       |     |     |
|        | public  |        | void run(String |      | title,             | int | rate) | {   |     |
|        |         | JFrame | frame           | =    | new JFrame(title); |     |       |     |     |
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
frame.setResizable(false);
frame.add(this.grid);
frame.pack();
frame.setVisible(true);
this.mainloop(rate);
}
}
Automaton declares grid as an instance variable, so every Automaton “has a”
GridCanvas. It also provides run, which contains the code that creates and
| configures |     | the JFrame. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The run method takes two parameters: the window title and the frame
rate; that is, the number of time steps to show per second. It uses title
| when | creating |     | the JFrame, | and | it passes | rate | to mainloop: |     |     |

|      | private | void     | mainloop(int |     | rate)   | {   |     |     |
|      |         | while    | (true)       | {   |         |     |     |     |
|      |         | //       | update       | the | drawing |     |     |     |
this.update();
grid.repaint();
|     |     | //  | delay             | the                   | simulation |          |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | -------- | --- | --- |
|     |     | try | {                 |                       |            |          |     |     |
|     |     |     | Thread.sleep(1000 |                       |            | / rate); |     |     |
|     |     | }   | catch             | (InterruptedException |            | e)       | {   |     |
|     |     |     | //                | do nothing            |            |          |     |     |
}
}
}
mainloop contains the code you first saw in Section ??. It runs a while loop
forever (or until the window closes). Each time through the loop, it runs
| update |     | to update | grid | and | then repaint | to redraw | the grid. |     |
| ------ | --- | --------- | ---- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | --- |
Then it calls Thread.sleep with a delay that depends on rate. For example,
if rate is 2, we should draw two frames per second, so the delay is a half
| second, |     | or 500 | milliseconds. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
This process of reorganizing existing code, without changing its behavior, is
knownasrefactoring. We’realmostfinished; wejustneedtoredesignConway

If we were not planning to implement any other zero-person games, we could
leave well enough alone. But there are a few problems with the current design:
• The grid attribute is private, making it inaccessible in Conway and
Langton. We could make it public, but then other (unrelated) classes
|     | would | have | access | to  | it as well. |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ---- | ------ | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
• The Automaton class has no constructors, and even if it did, there would
|     | be  | no reason | to  | create | an instance | of this class. |     |     |
| --- | --- | --------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
• The Automaton class does not provide an implementation of update. In
|      | order    | to work  | properly, |          | subclasses | need        | to provide | one. |     |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---- | --- |
| Java | provides | language |           | features | to         | solve these | problems:  |      |     |
• We can make the grid attribute protected, which means it’s accessible
|     | to  | subclasses | but | not other | classes. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---------- | --- | --------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• We can make the class abstract, which means it cannot be instantiated.
If you attempt to create an object for an abstract class, you will get a
|     | compiler | error. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• We can declare update as an abstract method, meaning that it must
be overridden in subclasses. If the subclass does not override an abstract
|     | method, | you | will | get a | compiler | error. |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --- | ---- | ----- | -------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
Here’s what Automaton looks like as an abstract class (using the methods
| mainloop |        | and run   | from       | Section      | ??):      |        |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
|          | public | abstract  |            | class        | Automaton | {      |     |     |     |
|          |        | protected | GridCanvas |              | grid;     |        |     |     |     |
|          |        | public    | abstract   | void         | update(); |        |     |     |     |
|          |        | private   | void       | mainloop(int |           | rate)  | {   |     |     |
|          |        | //        | this       | method       | invokes   | update |     |     |     |
}
|     |     | public | void | run(String |         | title,   | int rate) | {   |     |
| --- | --- | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | --- | --- |
|     |     | //     | this | method     | invokes | mainloop |           |     |     |
}
}
Notice that the update method has no body. The declaration specifies the
name, arguments, andreturntype. Butitdoesnotprovideanimplementation,
| because |     | it is an | abstract | method. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | -------- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Noticealsothewordabstractonthefirstline, whichdeclaresthatAutomaton

| declared |     | as abstract. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Any class that extends Automaton must provide an implementation of update;

| Here’s | what        | Conway          | looks   | like as            | a subclass |           | of Automaton: |            |     |

|        |             | String          |         | title = "Conway's  |            | Game      | of Life";     |            |     |
|        |             | Conway          |         | game = new         | Conway();  |           |               |            |     |
|        |             | game.run(title, |         |                    | 2);        |           |               |            |     |
}
}
Conway extends Automaton, so it inherits the protected instance variable
grid and the methods mainloop and run. But because Automaton is abstract,
Conway has to provide update and a constructor (which it has already).
Abstractclassesareessentially“incomplete” classdefinitionsthatspecifymeth-
ods to be implemented by subclasses. But they also provide attributes and
| methods |     | to be | inherited, | thus eliminating |     | repeated | code. |     |     |

At the beginning of the chapter, we had three classes: Cell, GridCanvas,
and Conway. We then developed Langton, which had almost the same main
and mainloop methods as Conway. So we refactored the code and created
| Automaton. |     | Figure | ??  | summarizes | the | final | design. |     |     |

The diagram shows three examples of inheritance: Conway is an Automaton,
Langton is an Automaton, and GridCanvas is a Canvas. It also shows two
examples of composition: Automaton has a GridCanvas, and GridCanvas has

Conway and Langton are concrete classes, because they provide an imple-

When we first looked at inheritance in Chapter ??, our purpose was to avoid
duplicating code. We noticed that “decks of cards” and “hands of cards” had
common functionality, and we designed a CardCollection class to provide it.
This technique is an example of generalization. By generalizing the code,
| we were | able to reuse | it in the Deck | and Hand | classes. |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
In Chapter ??, we looked at inheritance from a different point of view. When
designing GridCanvas to represent a grid of cells, we extended Canvas and
overrode its paint method. This design is an example of specialization.
Using the code provided by Canvas, we created a specialized subclass with
| minimal | additional | code. |     |     |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- |
We didn’t write the code for Canvas; it’s part of the Java library. But we
were able to customize it for our own purposes. In fact, the Canvas class was
| explicitly | designed | to be extended. |     |     |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- | --- | --- |
In this chapter, we’ll explore the concept of inheritance more fully and present
event-driven programming. We’ll continue to develop graphical simulations as

The word polygon means “many angles”; the most basic polygons are triangles
(three angles), rectangles (four angles), pentagons (five angles), and so forth.

| 280 |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 17 Advanced | Topics |

Polygons are an important part of computer graphics because they are used
| to compose | more complex | images. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Java provides a Polygon class (in java.awt) that we can use to represent and
draw polygons. The following code creates an empty Polygon and adds three
| points,         | forming a triangle: |              |          |             |               |           |     |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | --- |
| Polygon         | p = new             | Polygon();   |          |             |               |           |     |
| p.addPoint(57,  |                     | 110);        |          |             |               |           |     |
| p.addPoint(100, |                     | 35);         |          |             |               |           |     |
| p.addPoint(143, |                     | 110);        |          |             |               |           |     |
| Internally,     | Polygon             | objects have | three    | attributes: |               |           |     |
| • public        | int                 | npoints;     | // total | number      |               | of points |     |
| • public        | int[]               | xpoints;     | // array | of          | X coordinates |           |     |
| • public        | int[]               | ypoints;     | // array | of          | Y coordinates |           |     |
When a Polygon is created, npoints is 0 and the two arrays are initialized
with length 4. As points are added, npoints is incremented. If npoints
exceeds the length of the arrays, larger arrays are created, and the previous
| values | are copied over | (similar | to how ArrayList |     | works). |     |     |

The Polygon class provides many useful methods, like contains, intersects,
and translate. We’ll get to those later, but first we’re going to do some
specialization.
| 17.2 | Adding | Color |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Specialization is useful for adding new features to an existing class, especially
when you can’t (or don’t want to) change its design. For example, we can
extend the Polygon class by adding a draw method and a Color attribute:

| 17.3   | Regular   | Polygons          |     |        |         |         |     | 281 |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------- | --- | ------ | ------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| public | class     | DrawablePolygon   |     |        | extends | Polygon | {   |     |
|        | protected | Color             |     | color; |         |         |     |     |
|        | public    | DrawablePolygon() |     |        | {       |         |     |     |
super();
|     | color | =   | Color.GRAY; |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
}
|     | public | void | draw(Graphics |     | g)  | {   |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ---- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
g.setColor(color);
g.fillPolygon(this);
}
}
As a reminder, constructors are not inherited when you extend a class. If you
don’t define a constructor, the compiler will generate one that does nothing.
The constructor for DrawablePolygon uses super to invoke the constructor
for Polygon, which initializes the attributes npoints, xpoints, and ypoints.
| Then | DrawablePolygon |     | initializes |     | the color | attribute | to GRAY. |     |
| ---- | --------------- | --- | ----------- | --- | --------- | --------- | -------- | --- |
DrawablePolygon has the same attributes and methods that Polygon has, so
you can use addPoint as before, or you can directly access npoints, xpoints,
andypoints(sincetheyarepublic). Youcanalsousemethodslikecontains,
| intersects, |     | and translate. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The following code creates a DrawablePolygon with the same points as in the
| previous        | section | and          | sets     | its color              | to GREEN: |     |     |     |

| p.addPoint(57,  |         |              | 110);    |                        |           |     |     |     |
| p.addPoint(100, |         |              | 35);     |                        |           |     |     |     |
| p.addPoint(143, |         |              | 110);    |                        |           |     |     |     |
| p.color         | =       | Color.GREEN; |          |                        |           |     |     |     |

In mathematics, a regular polygon has all sides the same length and all angles
equal in measure. Regular polygons are a special case of polygons, so we will
| use | specialization | to  | define | a class | for them. |     |     |     |

We could extend the Polygon class, as we did in the previous section. But
then we would not have the Color functionality we just added. So we will
| make | RegularPolygon |     |     | extend | DrawablePolygon. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | -------------- | --- | --- | ------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To construct a RegularPolygon, we specify the number of sides, the radius
(distance from the center to a vertex), and the color. For example:
|     | RegularPolygon |     |     | rp = new | RegularPolygon(6, |     |     | 50, Color.BLUE); |     |     |
| --- | -------------- | --- | --- | -------- | ----------------- | --- | --- | ---------------- | --- | --- |

radius and angle θ. The center of the polygon is at the origin (0,0).

The constructor uses trigonometry to find the coordinates of each vertex. Fig-
ure ?? illustrates the process. The number of sides (n = 6) and the radius
| (r  | = 50) | are given | as  | parameters. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

This constructor initializes all four DrawablePolygon attributes, so it doesn’t
| have | to invoke | super(). |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

It initializes xpoints and ypoints by creating arrays of integer coordinates.
Inside the for loop, it uses Math.sin and Math.cos (see Section 4.6) to com-
pute the coordinates of the vertices as floating-point numbers. Then it rounds
| them | off to integers |     | and stores |     | them in | the | arrays. |     |     |     |

When we construct a RegularPolygon, the vertices are centered at the point
(0,0). If we want the center of the polygon to be somewhere else, we can use
| translate,        | which |     | we inherit | from | Polygon:          |     |     |     |              |     |

| 17.4 | More | Constructors |     |     |         |             |        |
Classes in the Java library often have more than one constructor for conve-
nience. We can do the same with RegularPolygon. For example, we can make
| the color | parameter          | optional |     | by defining  | a second | constructor: |     |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------- | --- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ | --- |
| public    | RegularPolygon(int |          |     | nsides,      | int      | radius) {    |     |
|           | this(nsides,       | radius,  |     | Color.GRAY); |          |              |     |
}
The keyword this, when used in a constructor, invokes another constructor
in the same class. It has a similar syntax as the keyword super, which invokes
| a constructor | in the             | superclass. |            |           |     |               |     |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --- | ------------- | --- |
| Similarly,    | we could           | make        | the radius | parameter |     | optional too: |     |
| public        | RegularPolygon(int |             |            | nsides)   | {   |               |     |
|               | this(nsides,       | 50);        |            |           |     |               |     |
}
Now, suppose we invoke the RegularPolygon constructor like this:
| RegularPolygon |     | rp = | new | RegularPolygon(6); |     |     |     |
| -------------- | --- | ---- | --- | ------------------ | --- | --- | --- |
Because we provide only one integer argument, Java calls the third construc-
tor, which calls the second one, which calls the first one. The result is a
RegularPolygon with the specified value of nsides, 6, the default value of
| radius, | 50, and the | default | color, | GRAY. |     |     |     |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
When writing constructors, it’s a good idea to validate the values you get as
arguments. Doing so prevents run-time errors later in the program, which
| makes | the code easier | to  | debug. |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --------------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
For RegularPolygon, the number of sides should be at least three, the radius
should be greater than zero, and the color should not be null. We can add
| the following | lines | to the | first | constructor: |     |     |     |

}
|     | //  | the | rest | of the | method is | omitted |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | ------ | --------- | ------- | --- | --- |
In this example, we throw an exception to indicate that one of the arguments
is invalid. By default, these exceptions terminate the program and display an
| error | message | along | with | the stack | trace. |     |     |     |

The Drawing class has an ArrayList of DrawablePolygon objects. When we
create a Drawing object, the list is initially empty. The add method takes a

|     | Figure | 17.2: Initial | drawing | of three RegularPolygon | objects. |     |
| --- | ------ | ------------- | ------- | ----------------------- | -------- | --- |
The first block of code creates RegularPolygon objects with 3, 6, and 360
sides. As you can see, a polygon with 360 sides is a pretty good approximation
of a circle.
The second block of code translates the polygons to different locations. The
third block of code creates the Drawing and adds the polygons to it. And the
fourth block of code creates a JFrame, adds the Drawing to it, and displays
the result.
Most of these pieces should be familiar, but one part of this program might
surprise you. When we create the RegularPolygon objects, we assign them
to DrawablePolygon variables. It might not be obvious why that’s legal.
RegularPolygon extends DrawablePolygon, so every RegularPolygon ob-
ject is also a DrawablePolygon. The parameter of Drawing.add has to be
a DrawablePolygon, but it can be any type of DrawablePolygon, including
| RegularPolygon |     | and other | subclasses. |     |     |     |

Thisdesignisanexampleofpolymorphism,afancywordthatmeans“having
many forms”. Drawing.add is a polymorphic method, because the parameter
can be one of many types. And the ArrayList in Drawing is a polymorphic
| data | structure, | because | the elements | can | be different | types. |     |

| 17.6 | Blinking   |         | Polygons     |     |              |        |     |
At this point, we have a simple program that draws polygons; we can make it
more fun by adding animation. Chapter introduced the idea of simulating
??
| time  | steps. | Here’s a loop | that | runs the | animation: |     |     |
| ----- | ------ | ------------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| while | (true) | {             |      |          |            |     |     |
drawing.step();
|     | try     | {                     |     |        |      |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --------------------- | --- | ------ | ---- | --- | --- |
|     |         | Thread.sleep(1000     |     | / 30); |      |     |     |
|     | } catch | (InterruptedException |     |        | e) { |     |     |
|     |         | // do nothing         |     |        |      |     |     |
}
}
Each time through the loop, we call step to update the Drawing. Then we
sleep with a delay calculated to update about 30 times per second.
| Here’s | what | the step         | method | of Drawing | looks like: |     |     |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| public | void | step()           | {      |            |             |     |     |
|        | for  | (DrawablePolygon |        | dp :       | list) {     |     |     |
dp.step();
}
repaint();
}
It invokes step on each DrawablePolygon in the list and then repaints (clears
| and | redraws) | the canvas. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
In order for this code to compile, we need DrawablePolygon to provide a
step method. Here’s a version that doesn’t do anything; we’ll override it in
subclasses:

| 17.6   | Blinking | Polygons |     |     |     |     | 289 |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public | void     | step()   | {   |     |     |     |     |
|        | // do    | nothing  |     |     |     |     |     |
}
Now let’s design a new type of polygon that blinks. We’ll define a class
namedBlinkingPolygonthatextendsRegularPolygonandaddstwomoreat-
tributes: visible, which indicates whether the polygon is visible, and count,
| which  | counts the    | number              | of time steps | since the last         | blink:      |       |      |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ---- |
| public | class         | BlinkingPolygon     |               | extends RegularPolygon |             | {     |      |
|        | protected     | boolean             | visible;      |                        |             |       |      |
|        | protected     | int                 | count;        |                        |             |       |      |
|        | public        | BlinkingPolygon(int |               | nsides,                | int radius, | Color | c) { |
|        | super(nsides, |                     | radius,       | c);                    |             |       |      |
|        | visible       |                     | = true;       |                        |             |       |      |
|        | count         | =                   | 0;            |                        |             |       |      |
}
|     | public | void      | draw(Graphics | g) { |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --------- | ------------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | if     | (visible) | {             |      |     |     |     |
super.draw(g);
}
}
|     | public | void | step() { |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
count++;
|     | if  | (count  | == 10) {    |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | visible | = !visible; |     |     |     |     |
|     |     | count   | = 0;        |     |     |     |     |
}
}
}
The constructor uses super to call the RegularPolygon constructor. Then it
initializes visible and count. Initially, the BlinkingPolygon is visible.
The draw method draws the polygon only if it is visible. It uses super to
call draw in the parent class. But the parent class is RegularPolygon, which

| 290 |     |     |     |     | Chapter |     | 17 Advanced | Topics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | ----------- | ------ |
does not provide a draw method. In this case, super invokes draw from the
| DrawablePolygon |     | class. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The step method increments count. Every 10 time steps, it toggles visible
| and resets | count      | to 0. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 17.7       | Interfaces |       |     |     |     |     |     |     |
You might be getting tired of polygons at this point. Can’t we draw anything
else? Of course we can, but Drawing is currently based on DrawablePolygon.
| To draw other |     | types of objects, |     | we have | to generalize |     | the code. |     |
| ------------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | ------- | ------------- | --- | --------- | --- |
The Drawing class does essentially three things: (1) it maintains a list of
objects, (2) it invokes the draw method on each object, and (3) it invokes the
| step method | on      | each object. |      |          |      |          |     |     |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- |
| So here’s   | one way | we could     | make | the code | more | general: |     |     |
1. Define a new superclass, which we call Actor, that provides the two
| methods |        | needed by | Drawing:      |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public  |        | class     | Actor {       |     |     |     |     |     |
|         | public | void      | draw(Graphics |     | g)  | {   |     |     |
|         |        | // do     | nothing       |     |     |     |     |     |
}
|     | public | void  | step()  | {   |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |        | // do | nothing |     |     |     |     |     |
}
}
| 2. In the | Drawing | class,  | replace | DrawablePolygon |     |        | with Actor. |     |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | --- |
| 3. Any    | class   | that we | want to | draw must       | now | extend | Actor.      |     |
There’s just one problem: DrawablePolygon already extends Polygon, and
classes can extend only one superclass. Also, the Actor class seems pointless,
| since the | methods | it defines | don’t | do anything. |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Java provides another mechanism for inheritance that solves these problems.
We can define Actor as an interface instead of a class, like this:

17.7 Interfaces 291
| public |      | interface     | Actor | {   |     |     |
| ------ | ---- | ------------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
|        | void | draw(Graphics |       | g); |     |     |
|        | void | step();       |       |     |     |     |
}
Like a class definition, an interface definition contains methods. But it con-
tains only the declarations of the methods, not their implementations.
Like an abstract class, an interface specifies methods that must be provided
by subclasses. The difference is that an abstract class can implement some
| methods; |     | an interface | cannot. |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ------------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
All interface methods are public by default, since they are intended to be
used by other classes. So there is no need to declare them as public.
To inherit from an interface, you use the keyword implements instead of
extends. Here’s a version of DrawablePolygon that extends Polygon and
implements Actor. So it inherits methods from Polygon, and it is required to
| provide | the | methods | in Actor; | namely | draw | and step: |
| ------- | --- | ------- | --------- | ------ | ---- | --------- |
public class DrawablePolygon extends Polygon implements Actor {
|     | //  | rest | of the | class omitted |     |     |
| --- | --- | ---- | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- |
}
In terms of inheritance, DrawablePolygon is both a Polygon and an Actor.
| So the  | following | assignments |                        | are legal: |     |     |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| Polygon |           | p1 =        | new DrawablePolygon(); |            |     |     |
| Actor   |           | a2 = new    | DrawablePolygon();     |            |     |     |
And the same is true for subclasses of DrawablePolygon; these assignments
| are legal | too: |          |                       |     |     |                    |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | --------------------- | --- | --- | ------------------ |
| Polygon   |      | p2 =     | new RegularPolygon(5, |     |     | 50, Color.YELLOW); |
| Actor     |      | a2 = new | RegularPolygon(5,     |     |     | 50, Color.YELLOW); |
Interfaces are another example of polymorphism. a1 and a2 are the same type
of variable, but they refer to objects with different types. And similarly with
p1 and p2.
Classes may extend only one superclass, but they may implement as many
interfaces as needed. Java library classes often implement multiple interfaces.

Now that our Drawing is based on Actor instead of DrawablePolygon, we can
draw other types of graphics. Here is the beginning of a class that reads an
image from a file and shows the image moving across the canvas. The class
is called Sprite because a moving image is sometimes called a sprite, in the
| context | of computer | graphics:          |            |                    |                    |              |     |     |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ | --- | --- |
| public  | class       | Sprite             | implements |                    | Actor, KeyListener |              | {   |     |
|         | private     | int xpos;          |            |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         | private     | int ypos;          |            |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         | private     | int dx;            |            |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         | private     | int dy;            |            |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         | private     | Image              | image;     |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         | public      | Sprite(String      |            | path,              | int xpos,          | int ypos)    | {   |     |
|         | this.xpos   |                    | = xpos;    |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         | this.ypos   |                    | = ypos;    |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         | try         | {                  |            |                    |                    |              |     |     |
|         |             | this.image         |            | = ImageIO.read(new |                    | File(path)); |     |     |
|         | }           | catch (IOException |            |                    | exc) {             |              |     |     |
exc.printStackTrace();
}
}
}
The instance variables xpos and ypos represent the location of the sprite. dx
and dy represent the velocity of the sprite in the and directions.
x y
The constructor takes as parameters the name of a file and the initial position.
It uses ImageIO, from the javax.imageio package, to read the file. If an error
occurs during reading, an IOException is caught, and the program displays
| the | stack trace | for debugging. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Sprite implements two interfaces: Actor and KeyListener. Actor requires
| that | we provide | draw and | step | methods: |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 17.8 | Event  | Listeners          |               |     |             |        | 293 |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------ | ------------- | --- | ----------- | ------ | --- |
|      | public | void               | draw(Graphics |     | g) {        |        |     |
|      |        | g.drawImage(image, |               |     | xpos, ypos, | null); |     |
}
|     | public | void | step() | {   |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ---- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |        | xpos | += dx; |     |     |     |     |
|     |        | ypos | += dy; |     |     |     |     |
}
The draw method draws the image at the sprite’s current position. The step
method changes the position based on dx and dy, which are initially zero.
KeyListener is an interface for receiving keyboard events, which means we
can detect and respond to key presses. A class that implements KeyListener
| has  | to provide          | the | following | methods: |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------------------- | --- | --------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| void | keyPressed(KeyEvent |     |           | e)       |     |     |     |
Invoked when a key has been “pressed”. This method is invoked repeat-
|      | edly                 | while a | key is | being held | down. |     |     |

| void | keyReleased(KeyEvent |         |        |            | e)    |     |     |
Invoked when a key has been “released”, meaning it is no longer down.
| void | keyTyped(KeyEvent |     |     | e)  |     |     |     |
| ---- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Invoked when a key has been “typed”, which generally means it has been
|     | both | pressed | and released. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
These methods get invoked when the user presses and releases any key. They
take a KeyEvent object as a parameter, which specifies which key was pressed,
| released, |     | or typed. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
We can use these methods to design a simple animation using the arrow keys.
When the user presses up or down, the sprite will move up or down. When
| the | user | presses left | or right, | the | sprite will move | left or right. |     |
| --- | ---- | ------------ | --------- | --- | ---------------- | -------------- | --- |
Here’s an implementation of keyPressed that uses a switch statement to test
which arrow key was pressed and sets dx or dy accordingly. (There is no
| default |     | branch, so | we ignore | all | other keys.) |     |     |
| ------- | --- | ---------- | --------- | --- | ------------ | --- | --- |

294 Chapter 17 Advanced Topics
public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
switch (e.getKeyCode()) {
case KeyEvent.VK_UP:
dy = -5;
break;
case KeyEvent.VK_DOWN:
dy = +5;
break;
case KeyEvent.VK_LEFT:
dx = -5;
break;
case KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT:
dx = +5;
break;
}
}
The values of dx and dy determine how much the sprite moves each time step
is invoked. While the user holds down an arrow key, the sprite will move at a
constant speed.
Here’s an implementation of keyReleased that runs when the user releases
the key:
public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
switch (e.getKeyCode()) {
case KeyEvent.VK_UP:
case KeyEvent.VK_DOWN:
dy = 0;
break;
case KeyEvent.VK_LEFT:
case KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT:
dx = 0;
break;
}
}
When the user releases the key, keyReleased sets dx or dy to 0, so the sprite
stops moving in that direction.

17.9 Timers 295
We don’t need the keyTyped method for this example, but it’s required by the
interface; if we don’t provide one, the compiler will complain. So we provide
| an implementation |       | that              | does | nothing: |      |     |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ---- | -------- | ---- | --- |
| public            | void  | keyTyped(KeyEvent |      |          | e) { |     |
|                   | // do | nothing           |      |          |      |     |
}
Now, here’s the code we need to create a Sprite, add it to a Drawing, and
| configure | it as  | a KeyListener: |     |                          |     |           |
| --------- | ------ | -------------- | --- | ------------------------ | --- | --------- |
| Sprite    | sprite | =              | new | Sprite("face-smile.png", |     | 25, 150); |
drawing.add(sprite);
drawing.addKeyListener(sprite);
drawing.setFocusable(true);
Recall that the add method is one that we wrote in Section ??. It adds an
| Actor | to the | list of | objects | to be | drawn. |     |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------ | --- |
TheaddKeyListenermethodisinheritedfromCanvas. ItaddsaKeyListener
| to the | list of objects |     | that | will receive | key events. |     |
| ------ | --------------- | --- | ---- | ------------ | ----------- | --- |
In graphical applications, key events are sent to components only when they
have the keyboard focus. The setFocusable method ensures that drawing
will have the focus initially, without the user having to click it first.
| 17.9 | Timers |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Now that you know about interfaces and events, we can show you a better
way to create animations. Previously, we implemented the animation loop
by using while (true) and Thread.sleep. Java provides a Timer class (in
| javax.swing) |     | that encapsulates |     |     | this behavior. |     |
| ------------ | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | -------------- | --- |
A Timer is useful for executing code at regular intervals. The constructor for
| Timer            | takes two | parameters: |          |     |                 |                |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- | --- | --------------- | -------------- |
| • int            | delay     |             |          |     | // milliseconds | between events |
| • ActionListener |           |             | listener |     | // for handling | timer events   |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | --- | -------- | ------ |
The ActionListener interface requires only one method, actionPerformed.
| This | is the method | the | Timer | invokes | after | the given | delay. |     |     |
| ---- | ------------- | --- | ----- | ------- | ----- | --------- | ------ | --- | --- |
Using a Timer, we can reorganize the code in main by defining a class that
| implements | ActionListener: |             |        |              |                          |                |     |     |          |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- | --- | --- | -------- |
| public     | class           | VideoGame   |        | implements   |                          | ActionListener |     | {   |          |
|            | private         | Drawing     |        | drawing;     |                          |                |     |     |          |
|            | public          | VideoGame() |        | {            |                          |                |     |     |          |
|            | Sprite          |             | sprite | = new        | Sprite("face-smile.png", |                |     |     | 50, 50); |
|            | drawing         |             | = new  | Drawing(800, |                          | 600);          |     |     |          |
drawing.add(sprite);

drawing.setFocusable(true);
|     | JFrame |     | frame | = new | JFrame("Video |     | Game"); |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ----- | ----- | ------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
frame.add(drawing);
frame.pack();
frame.setVisible(true);
}
|     | public | void | actionPerformed(ActionEvent |     |     |     | e)  | {   |     |
| --- | ------ | ---- | --------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
drawing.step();
}
|     | public    | static | void | main(String[] |              | args)  | {   |     |     |
| --- | --------- | ------ | ---- | ------------- | ------------ | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
|     | VideoGame |        | game | = new         | VideoGame(); |        |     |     |     |
|     | Timer     | timer  |      | = new         | Timer(33,    | game); |     |     |     |
timer.start();
}
}
The main method constructs a VideoGame object, which creates a Sprite, a
Drawing, and a JFrame. Then it constructs a Timer object and starts the
timer. Every 33 milliseconds, the Timer invokes actionPerformed, which
| invokes | step on | the | Drawing. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Drawing.step invokes step on all of its Actor objects, which causes them

to update their position, color, or other aspects of their appearance. The
Drawing.step then repaints the Canvas, and the time step is done.
At this point, you have all of the elements you need to write your own video
games. In the exercises at the end of this chapter, we have some suggestions

the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.

| ------- | ------------ | --- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
Exercise 17.1 The Polygon class does not provide a toString method; it
inherits the default toString from java.lang.Object, which includes only
the class’s name and memory location. Write a more useful toString method
| for DrawablePolygon |     | that | includes | its (x,y) | points. |     |     |

| --- | --- | --- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
Exercise 17.2 Write a class MovingPolygon that extends RegularPolygon
and implements Actor. It should have instance variables posx and posy that
specify its position, and dx and dy that specify its velocity (and direction).
During each time step, it should update its position. If it gets to the edge of
the Drawing, it should reverse direction by changing the sign of dx or dy.
Exercise 17.3 Modify the VideoGame class so it displays a Sprite and a
MovingPolygon (from the previous exercise). Add code that detects collisions
between Actor objects in the same Drawing, and invoke a method on both
| objects when | they | collide. |     |     |     |
| ------------ | ---- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
Hint: You might want to add a method to the Actor interface, guaranteeing
| that all Actor | objects | know how to handle | collisions. |     |     |

Tools
The steps for compiling, running, and debugging Java code depend on your
development environment and operating system. We avoided putting these
| details | in the main text, | because | they can be | distracting. |     |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------ | --- |
Instead, we provide this appendix with a brief introduction to DrJava—an
in-
|          |             |             | (IDE) | that is helpful | for beginners— |

and other development tools, including Checkstyle for code quality and JUnit
for testing.
| A.1 | Installing | DrJava |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
The easiest way to start programming in Java is to use a website that compiles
and runs Java code in the browser. Examples include https://repl.it/,
| https://trinket.io/, |     | https://jdoodle.com/, |     | and others. |     |
| -------------------- | --- | --------------------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
If you are unable to install software on your computer (which is often the case
in public schools and Internet cafés), you can use these online development
| environments | for almost | everything | in this book. |     |     |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --- | --- |
But if you want to compile and run Java programs on your own computer, you
| will need | the following: |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 300 |     |     |     |     |     | Appendix | A Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | ------- |
• The Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the compiler, the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that interprets the compiled byte code,
|     | and | other tools | such as | Javadoc. |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
• A text editor such as Atom, Notepad++, or Sublime Text, and/or an
|     | IDE | such as | DrJava, Eclipse, | jGrasp, | or  | NetBeans. |     |
| --- | --- | ------- | ---------------- | ------- | --- | --------- | --- |
The JDK we recommend is OpenJDK, an open source implementation of
Java SE (Standard Edition). The IDE we recommend is DrJava, which is
an open source development environment written in Java (see Figure ??).
To install OpenJDK, visit https://adoptopenjdk.net. Download and run
| the | installer | for your | operating | system. |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
To install DrJava, visit http://drjava.org/ and download the file.
JAR
We recommend that you save it to your Desktop folder or another convenient
location. Simply double-click the JAR file to run DrJava. Refer to the DrJava
documentation (http://drjava.org/docs/quickstart/) for more details.
|     |     | Figure | A.1: DrJava | editing | the Hello | World program. |     |
| --- | --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- | --------- | -------------- | --- |
When running DrJava for the first time, we recommend you change three
settings from the Edit > Preferences menu under Miscellaneous: set the Indent
Level to 4, check the Automatically Close Block Comments box, and uncheck
| the | Keep | Emacs-style | Backup | Files box. |     |     |     |

| --- | ------------------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
| A.2 | DrJava              | Interactions |     |     |
One of the most useful features of DrJava is the “Interactions” pane at the
bottom of the window. It provides the ability to try out code quickly, without
havingtowriteaclassdefinitionandsave/compile/runtheprogram. Figure??
| shows | an example. |                       |                 |     |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------------- | --------------- | --- |
|       | Figure      | A.2: The Interactions | pane in DrJava. |     |
There is one subtle detail to note when using the Interactions pane. If you
don’tendanexpression(orstatement)withasemicolon, DrJavaautomatically
displays its value. Notice in Figure ?? that the variable declarations end with
semicolons, but the logic expressions in the following lines do not. This feature
| saves you | from having | to type System.out.println | every time. |     |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
What’s nice about this feature is that you don’t have to create a new class, de-
clare a main method, write arbitrary expressions inside System.out.println
statements, save the source file, and get all of your code to compile in advance.
Also, you can press the up/down arrows on the keyboard to repeat previous
| commands | and experiment | with incremental | differences. |     |

| A.3 | Command-Line | Interface |     |          |         |
One of the most powerful and useful skills you can learn is how to use the
command-line interface, also called the “terminal”. The command line is a
directinterfacetotheoperatingsystem. Itallowsyoutorunprograms,manage
filesanddirectories, andmonitorsystemresources. Manyadvancedtools, both
for software development and general-purpose computing, are available only
| at the | command line. |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Manygoodtutorialsareavailableonlineforlearningthecommandlineforyour
operating system; just search the web for “command line tutorial”. On Unix
systems like Linux and macOS, you can get started with just four commands:
change the working directory (cd), list directory contents (ls), compile Java
| programs | (javac), | and run Java programs | (java). |     |     |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------- | ------- | --- | --- |
Figure ?? shows an example in which the Hello.java source file is stored in the
Desktop directory. After changing to that location and listing the files, we use
the javac command to compile Hello.java. Running ls again, we see that the
compiler generated a new file, Hello.class, which contains the byte code. We
run the program by using the java command, which displays the output on
| the following | line.          |             |     |                  |       |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- | --- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Figure        | A.3: Compiling | and running |     | from the command | line. |

Note that the javac command requires a filename (or multiple source files
separated by spaces), whereas the java command requires a single class name.
If you use DrJava, it runs these commands for you behind the scenes and
| displays | the output | in the Interactions | pane. |     |     |

Taking time to learn this efficient and elegant way of interacting with the
operating system will make you more productive. People who don’t use the

As described in Section 1.9, it’s more effective to program and debug your
code little by little than to attempt writing everything all at once. And after
you’ve completed programming an algorithm, it’s important to test that it
| works | correctly |     | on a | variety | of  | inputs. |     |     |     |     |
| ----- | --------- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Throughout the book, we illustrate techniques for testing your programs.
Most, if not all, testing is based on a simple idea: does the program do what
we expect it to do? For simple programs, it’s not difficult to run them several
times and see what happens. But at some point, you will get tired of typing
| the | same | test     | cases over | and     | over. |          |           |           |          |        |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------- | ----- | -------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| We  | can  | automate | the        | process | of    | entering | input and | comparing |          |        |
|     |      |          |            |         |       |          |           |           | expected | output |
with using the command line. The basic idea is to store the test
|     | actual | output |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

|     |           | java | Convert | <   | test.in | >            | test.out |     |     |     |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | ------- |
On the command line, < and > are redirection operators. The first one
redirects the contents of test.in to System.in, as if it were entered from the
keyboard. The second one redirects the contents of System.out to a new file
test.out, much like a screen capture. In other words, the file contains
test.out
| the output | of your | program. |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
By the way, it’s perfectly okay to compile your programs in DrJava (or another
environment) and run them from the command line. Knowing both techniques
| allows you | to use the | right tool | for the job. |     |     |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
Figure A.4: Using meld to compare expected output with the actual output.
At this point, we just need to compare the contents test.out with test.exp.
If the files are the same, then the program outputted what we expected it to
output. If not, then we found a bug, and we can use the output to begin
debugging our program. Fortunately, there’s a simple way to compare files on
| the command | line:    |          |     |     |     |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| diff        | test.exp | test.out |     |     |     |
The diff utility summarizes the differences between two files. If there are
no differences, it displays nothing, which in our case is what we want. If the
expectedoutputdiffersfromtheactualoutput, weneedtocontinuedebugging.
Usually, the program is at fault, and diff provides some insight about what

is broken. But there’s also a chance that we have a correct program and the
| expected | output | is wrong. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Interpreting the results from diff can be confusing, but fortunately many
graphical tools can show the differences between two files. For example, on
Windows you can install WinMerge, on macOS you can use opendiff (which
comes with Xcode), and on Linux there’s meld, shown in Figure ??.
Regardless of what tool you use, the goal is the same. Debug your program
| until the | actual  | output | is identical |     | to the expected | output. |     |     |

Checkstyle is a command-line tool that can be used to determine if your source
code follows a set of style rules. It also checks for common programming
| mistakes, | such | as class | and | method | design problems. |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- |
You can download the latest version as a JAR file from https://checkstyle.
sourceforge.io/. To run Checkstyle, move (or copy) the JAR file to the
same directory as your program. Open a terminal in that location, and run
| the following |      | command:             |     |     |                       |     |        |     |

| java          | -jar | checkstyle-*-all.jar |     |     | -c /google_checks.xml |     | *.java |     |
The * characters are wildcards that match whatever version of Checkstyle
you have and whatever Java source files are present. The output indicates
the file and line number of each problem. This example refers to a method
| beginning        | on  | line 93, | column  | 5 of | Hello.java:     |     |     |     |

| Hello.java:93:5: |     |          | Missing | a    | Javadoc comment |     |     |     |
The file /google_checks.xml is inside the JAR file and represents most of
Google’s style rules. You can alternatively use /sun_checks.xml or provide
your own configuration file. See Checkstyle’s website for more information.
If you apply Checkstyle to your source code often, you will likely internalize

| 306 |     |     |     | Appendix | A Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | ------- |
Good comments make it easier for experienced developers to identify errors in
your code. Good variable names communicate the intent of your program and
how the data is organized. And good programs are designed to be efficient
| and demonstrably | correct. |                 |     |     |     |

| A.6              | Tracing  | with a Debugger |     |     |     |
A great way to visualize the flow of execution, including how parameters and
arguments work, is to use a debugger. Most debuggers make it possible to
do the following:
• Set a breakpoint, a line where you want the program to pause.
• Step through the code one line at a time and watch what it does.
• Check the values of variables and see when and how they change.
For example, open any program in DrJava and move the cursor to the first
line of main. Press Ctrl+B to toggle a breakpoint on the current line; it should
now be highlighted in red. Press Ctrl+Shift+D to turn on “Debug Mode”; a
new pane should appear at the bottom of the window. These commands are
also available from the Debugger menu, in case you forget the shortcut keys.
When you run the program, execution pauses at the first breakpoint. The
debugging pane displays the stack, with the current method on top of
call
the stack, as shown in Figure ??. You might be surprised to see how many
| methods | were called before | the main | method! |     |     |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------- | --- | --- |
To the right are several buttons that allow you to step through the code at
your own pace. You can also click Automatic Trace to watch DrJava run your
| code one | line at a time. |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Using a debugger is like having the computer proofread your code out loud.
When the program is paused, you can examine (or even change) the value of
| any variable | by using the | Interactions | pane. |     |     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----- | --- | --- |
Tracing allows you to follow the flow of execution and see how data passes
from one method to another. You might expect the code do one thing, but

line of printTwice. There is a breakpoint on the first line of main.
then the debugger shows it doing something else. At that moment, you gain
| insight | about | what may | be  | wrong | with the code. |     |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | --- | ----- | -------------- | --- |
You can edit your code while debugging it, but we don’t recommend it. If you
add or delete multiple lines of code while the program is paused, the results
can be confusing.

| using the | debugger | feature |      | of DrJava. |     |     |

| A.7       | Testing  |         | with | JUnit      |     |     |
When beginners start writing methods, they usually test them by invoking
them from main and checking the results by hand. For example, to test
| fibonacci | from | Section | ??, | we could | write this: |     |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | --- | -------- | ----------- | --- |

| 308    |                                  |      |               |       |       | Appendix        | A Tools |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---- | ------------- | ----- | ----- | --------------- | ------- |
| public | static                           | void | main(String[] |       | args) | {               |         |
|        | if (fibonacci(1)                 |      |               | != 1) | {     |                 |         |
|        | System.err.println("fibonacci(1) |      |               |       |       | is incorrect"); |         |
}
|     | if (fibonacci(2)                 |     |     | != 1) | {   |                 |     |
| --- | -------------------------------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --------------- | --- |
|     | System.err.println("fibonacci(2) |     |     |       |     | is incorrect"); |     |
}
|     | if (fibonacci(3)                 |     |     | != 2) | {   |                 |     |
| --- | -------------------------------- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --------------- | --- |
|     | System.err.println("fibonacci(3) |     |     |       |     | is incorrect"); |     |
}
}
This test code is self-explanatory, but it’s longer than it needs to be, and
it doesn’t scale very well. In addition, the error messages provide limited
information. For cases where we know the right answer, we can do better by
| writing | tests. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
unit
JUnit (https://junit.org/) is a common testing tool for Java programs. To
| use | it, you have | to create | a   | test class | that contains | test methods. |     |
| --- | ------------ | --------- | --- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | --- |
For example, suppose that the fibonacci method belongs to a class named
Series. Here is a corresponding JUnit1 test class and test method:
| import | junit.framework.TestCase; |            |                 |                       |          |     |     |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------- | -------- | --- | --- |
| public | class                     | SeriesTest |                 | extends               | TestCase | {   |     |
|        | public                    | void       | testFibonacci() |                       | {        |     |     |
|        | assertEquals(1,           |            |                 | Series.fibonacci(1)); |          |     |     |
|        | assertEquals(1,           |            |                 | Series.fibonacci(2)); |          |     |     |
|        | assertEquals(2,           |            |                 | Series.fibonacci(3)); |          |     |     |
}
}
This example uses the keyword extends, which indicates that the new class,
SeriesTest, is based on an existing class, TestCase. The TestCase class is
| imported | from | the package | junit.framework. |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
1This code is based on JUnit 3, which has been superseded but is the default version
| supported | by DrJava. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

A.8 Vocabulary 309
The names in this example follow convention: if the name of your class is
Something, the name of the test class should be SomethingTest. And if there
is a method in Something named someMethod, there should be a method in
| SomethingTest | named | testSomeMethod. |     |     |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------- | --- | --- |
Many development environments can generate test classes and test methods
automatically. In DrJava, you can select New JUnit Test Case from the File
| menu to | generate | an empty | test | class. |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ---- | ------ |
assertEquals is provided by the TestCase class. It takes two arguments and
checks whether they are equal. If so, it does nothing; otherwise, it displays
a detailed error message. The first argument is the value, which we
expected
considercorrect, andthesecondargumentistheactual valuewewanttocheck.
| If they | are not equal, | the | test fails. |     |
| ------- | -------------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
Using assertEquals is more concise than writing your own if statements
and System.err messages. JUnit provides additional assert methods, such
as assertNull, assertSame, and assertTrue, which can be used to design a
| variety | of tests. |     |     |     |
| ------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
To run JUnit directly from DrJava, click the button on the toolbar. If
Test
all your test methods pass, you will see a green bar in the lower-right corner.
Otherwise, DrJava will take you directly to the first assertion that failed.

| ----- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
Documentation comments: These start with /** and end with */, and
| describe | what | each | class and | method | does. |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ------ | ----- |
End-of-line and multiline comments are written primarily for yourself. They
help you remember specific details about your source code. Documentation
comments, on the other hand, are written for others. They explain how to use
| your classes | and | methods | in other | programs. |     |
| ------------ | --- | ------- | -------- | --------- | --- |
A nice feature of the Java language is the ability to embed documentation in
the source code itself. That way, you can write it as you go, and as things
change, it is easier to keep the documentation consistent with the code.
You can extract documentation from your source code, and generate well-
formatted HTML pages, using a tool called Javadoc. This tool is included
with the JDK, and it is widely used. In fact, the official documentation for
the Java library (https://thinkjava.org/apidoc) is generated by Javadoc.

| B.1 Reading |     | Documentation |          |           |
As an example, let’s look at the documentation for Scanner, a class we first
used in Section 3.2. You can find the documentation quickly by doing a web
search for “Java Scanner”. Figure ?? shows a screenshot of the page.
|     | Figure | B.1: The documentation | for Scanner. |     |
| --- | ------ | ---------------------- | ------------ | --- |
Documentation for other classes uses a similar format. The first line is the
package that contains the class, such as java.util. The second line is the
name of the class. The “All Implemented Interfaces” section lists some of the
| functionality | a Scanner | has. |     |     |
| ------------- | --------- | ---- | --- | --- |
The next section of the documentation is a narrative that explains the purpose
of the class and includes examples of how to use it. This text can be difficult
to read, because it may use terms you have not yet learned. But the examples
are often very useful. A good way to get started with a new class is to paste
the examples into a test file and see if you can compile and run them.
One of the examples shows how you can use a Scanner to read input from a
| String instead | of System.in: |     |     |     |
| -------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |

| Scanner |         | s     | = new         | Scanner(input); |        |     |      |      |        |     |     |

| For         | example, | here    | is the     | summary     |             | information |       | for     | nextInt:  |            |     |

The first line is the method’s signature, which specifies the name of the
method and its parameters (none). The type it returns (int) is not part of
the signature. The next line is a short description of what it does.
| The    | “Method | Detail” |            | explains | more:  |       |     |     |      |     |     |

The “Returns” section describes the result when the method succeeds. In
contrast, the “Throws” section describes possible errors and exceptions that
may occur. Exceptions are said to be thrown, like a referee throwing a flag, or
| like | a toddler | throwing | a fit. |     |     |     |     |     |

It might take you some time to get comfortable reading documentation and
learning which parts to ignore. But it’s worth the effort. Knowing what’s
available in the library helps you avoid reinventing the wheel. And a little bit
| of documentation |         | can | save you      | a lot of debugging. |     |     |     |     |

| B.2              | Writing |     | Documentation |                     |     |     |     |     |
As you benefit from reading good documentation, you should “pay it forward”
| by writing |     | good documentation. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Javadoc scans your source files looking for documentation comments, also
known as “Javadoc comments”. They begin with /** (two stars) and end with
*/ (one star). Anything in between is considered part of the documentation.
Here’s a class definition with two Javadoc comments, one for the Goodbye class
| and | one for | the main | method: |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
/**
|     | * Example | program | that | demonstrates | print |     | vs println. |     |
| --- | --------- | ------- | ---- | ------------ | ----- | --- | ----------- | --- |
*/
| public |     | class Goodbye |     | {   |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
/**
|     | *   | Prints a | greeting. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | -------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
*/
|     | public | static                     | void | main(String[] | args)    |     | {    |           |
| --- | ------ | -------------------------- | ---- | ------------- | -------- | --- | ---- | --------- |
|     |        | System.out.print("Goodbye, |      |               | ");      | //  | note | the space |
|     |        | System.out.println("cruel  |      |               | world"); |     |      |           |
}
}
The class comment explains the purpose of the class. The method comment
| explains | what | the method | does. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| --- | ------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Notice that this example also has an end-of-line comment (//). In general,
these comments are short phrases that help explain complex parts of a pro-
gram. They are intended for other programmers reading and maintaining the
source code.
In contrast, Javadoc comments are longer, usually complete sentences. They
explain what each method does, but they omit details about how the method
works. And they are intended for people who will use the methods without
| looking | at the | source | code. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Appropriate comments and documentation are essential for making source
code readable. And remember that the person most likely to read your code
| in the | future, | and | appreciate | good | documentation, |     | is you. |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | --- | ---------- | ---- | -------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
| B.3    | Javadoc |     | Tags       |      |                |     |         |     |     |
It’s generally a good idea to document each class and method, so that other
programmers can understand what they do without having to read the code.
To organize the documentation into sections, Javadoc supports optional tags
that begin with the at sign (@). For example, we can use @author and
| @version | to  | provide | information |     | about | the class: |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ------- | ----------- | --- | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
/**
| *   | Utility | class | for | extracting |     | digits | from integers. |     |     |

*/
| public        | class |          | DigitUtil |        | {     |        |     |        |          |

| Documentation |       | comments |           | should | begin | with a |     | of the | class or |

method, followed by the tags. These two sections are separated by a blank
| line (not | counting |     | the *). |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | -------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
For methods, we can use @param and @return to provide information about
| parameters | and | return | values: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

isSingleDigit
public static boolean isSingleDigit(int x)

| --- | ------ | --- | --------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | -------------- | --- |
When writing parameter comments, do not include a hyphen (-) after the
@param tag. Otherwise, you will have two hyphens in the resulting HTML
documentation.
Notice also that the @return tag should not specify the type of the method.
Comments like @return boolean are not useful, because you already know
| the return | type | from | the | method’s | signature. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | --- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Methods with multiple parameters should have separate @param tags that
describe each one. Void methods should have no @return tag, since they do
not return a value. Each tag should be on its own line in the source code.

Now let’s take a look at a more complete example. The code for this section is
in the appb directory of ThinkJavaCode2. See page x for instructions on how
to download the repository.
Professional-grade source files often begin with a copyright statement. This
text spans multiple lines, but it is not part of the documentation. So we
use a multiline comment (/*) rather than a documentation comment (/**).

Import statements generally follow the copyright text. After that, we can
define the class itself and begin writing the documentation (/**):

A common mistake that beginners make is to put import statements between
the documentation and the public class line. Doing so separates the doc-
umentation from the class itself. To avoid this issue, always make the end of
| the | comment | (the | */) | “touch” | the word | public. |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | ---- | --- | ------- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
This class has two constants and three methods. The constants are self-
explanatory, so there is no need to write documentation for them:
| public |     | static | final |     | double CM_PER_INCH |     | =     | 2.54; |     |
| ------ | --- | ------ | ----- | --- | ------------------ | --- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| public |     | static | final |     | int IN_PER_FOOT    |     | = 12; |       |     |
The methods, on the other hand, could use some explanation. Each documen-
tation comment includes a description, followed by a blank line, followed by a
| @param | tag | for each | parameter, |     | followed | by a | @return | tag: |     |
| ------ | --- | -------- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ---- | ------- | ---- | --- |
/**

|        | return |        | cm /   | CM_PER_INCH; |                   |     |     |     |     |

| public |        | static | double |                | toMetric(int  | feet, | int     | inches) | {   |

}
The main method has a similar documentation comment, except there is no
| @return | tag | since | the | method | is void: |     |     |     |     |

Here are two ways you can run the Javadoc tool on this example program:
• From the command line, go to the location for Convert.java. The -d

|     | • From  | DrJava,    | click  | the          |       | button |          | on the toolbar. |      | The IDE | will |
Javadoc
|     | then prompt |     | you for | a location |     | to generate |     | the HTML |     | files. |     |

Graphics
The Java library includes the package java.awt for drawing 2D graphics.
AWT stands for “Abstract Window Toolkit”. We are only going to scratch
the surface of graphics programming. You can read more about it in the Java
| tutorials (see https://thinkjava.org/java2d). |          |     |

| C.1 Creating                                  | Graphics |     |
There are several ways to create graphics in Java; the simplest way is to use
java.awt.Canvas and java.awt.Graphics. A Canvas is a blank rectangu-
larareaofthescreenontowhichtheapplicationcandraw. TheGraphicsclass
providesbasicdrawingmethodssuchasdrawLine,drawRect,anddrawString.
HereisanexampleprogramthatdrawsacirclebyusingthefillOvalmethod:
| import java.awt.Canvas;    |                 |          |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| import java.awt.Graphics;  |                 |          |
| import javax.swing.JFrame; |                 |          |
| public class               | Drawing extends | Canvas { |

| ------ | ------ | ----- | ---------------- | --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| public | static | void  | main(String[]    |     | args) {    |            |
|        | JFrame | frame | = new JFrame("My |     | Drawing"); |            |
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
|     | Drawing              | drawing | = new | Drawing(); |     |     |
| --- | -------------------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | --- | --- |
|     | drawing.setSize(400, |         |       | 400);      |     |     |
frame.add(drawing);
frame.pack();
frame.setVisible(true);
}
| public | void            | paint(Graphics |      | g) {       |     |     |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | --- |
|        | g.fillOval(100, |                | 100, | 200, 200); |     |     |
}
}
The Drawing class extends Canvas, so it has all the methods provided by
Canvas, including setSize. You can read about the other methods in the
documentation, which you can find by doing a web search for “Java Canvas”.
| In the main | method, | we do | the following: |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
1. CreateaJFrameobject,whichisthewindowthatwillcontainthecanvas.
2. Create a Drawing object (which is the canvas), set its width and height,
| and | add it to | the frame. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
3. Pack the frame (resize it) to fit the canvas, and display it on the screen.
Once the frame is visible, the paint method is called whenever the canvas
needs to be drawn; for example, when the window is moved or resized. If you
run this code, you should see a black circle on a gray background.
The application doesn’t end after the main method returns; instead, it waits
for the JFrame to close. When the JFrame closes, it calls System.exit, which
| ends the | program. |         |     |     |     |     |

| C.2      | Graphics | Methods |     |     |     |     |
You are probably used to Cartesian coordinates, where x and y values can
be positive or negative. In contrast, Java uses a coordinate system where the

| C.2 Graphics |     | Methods |     |     |     |     | 323 |
| ------------ | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
origin is in the upper-left corner. That way, x and y can always be positive
| integers.             | Figure ?? | shows these | coordinate | systems                    | side by side. |     |     |

coordinates.
Graphical coordinates are measured in pixels; each pixel corresponds to a dot
on the screen.
To draw on the canvas, you invoke methods on a Graphics object. You don’t
havetocreatetheGraphicsobject; itgetscreatedwhenyoucreatetheCanvas,
| and it gets | passed | as an argument | to paint. |     |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The previous example used fillOval, which has the following signature:
/**
| * Fills | an oval | bounded | by the | specified | rectangle | with |     |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ---- | --- |
| * the   | current | color.  |        |           |           |      |     |
*/
| public | void fillOval(int |     | x, int | y, int | width, int | height) |     |
| ------ | ----------------- | --- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------- | --- |
The four parameters specify a bounding box, which is the rectangle in which
the oval is drawn. x and y specify the location of the upper-left corner of the
bounding box. The bounding box itself is not drawn (see Figure ??).
To choose the color of a shape, invoke setColor on the Graphics object:
g.setColor(Color.RED);

bounding box
inscribed oval
|     |     | Figure | C.2: An oval | inside its | bounding | box. |
| --- | --- | ------ | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | ---- |
The setColor method determines the color of everything that gets drawn
afterward. Color.red is a constant provided by the Color class; to use it, you
have to import java.awt.Color. Other colors include the following:
| BLACK |     | BLUE    | CYAN   | DARKGRAY |     | GRAY LIGHTGRAY |
| ----- | --- | ------- | ------ | -------- | --- | -------------- |
| GREEN |     | MAGENTA | ORANGE | PINK     |     | WHITE YELLOW   |
You can create your own colors by specifying the red, green, and blue (RGB)
| components. | For    | example: |            |          |     |     |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ---------- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Color       | purple | = new    | Color(128, | 0, 128); |     |     |
Each value is an integer in the range 0 (darkest) to 255 (lightest). The color
| (0, 0, | 0) is black, | and | (255, 255, | 255) is white. |     |     |
| ------ | ------------ | --- | ---------- | -------------- | --- | --- |
You can set the background color of the Canvas by invoking setBackground:
canvas.setBackground(Color.WHITE);

Suppose we want to draw a “Hidden Mickey”, which is an icon that represents
Mickey Mouse (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Mickey). We
can use the oval we just drew as the face, and then add two ears. To make the
code more readable, let’s use Rectangle objects to represent bounding boxes.
| Here’s a | method | that | takes a Rectangle | and invokes |     | fillOval: |

| public |                  | void | boxOval(Graphics |     |       | g, Rectangle |             | bb) | {   |     |     |
|        | g.fillOval(bb.x, |      |                  |     | bb.y, | bb.width,    | bb.height); |     |     |     |     |
}
| And    | here’s             | a method |                 | that   | draws | Mickey Mouse:   |     |       |     |      |     |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------- | --------------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- | --- | ----- | --- | ---- | --- |

|        | boxOval(g,         |          |                 | bb);   |       |                 |     |       |     |      |     |
|        | int                | hx       | = bb.width      |        | / 2;  |                 |     |       |     |      |     |
|        | int                | hy       | = bb.height     |        | /     | 2;              |     |       |     |      |     |
|        | Rectangle          |          | half            |        | = new | Rectangle(bb.x, |     | bb.y, | hx, | hy); |     |
|        | half.translate(-hx |          |                 |        | /     | 2, -hy /        | 2); |       |     |      |     |
|        | boxOval(g,         |          |                 | half); |       |                 |     |       |     |      |     |
|        | half.translate(hx  |          |                 |        | * 2,  | 0);             |     |       |     |      |     |
|        | boxOval(g,         |          |                 | half); |       |                 |     |       |     |      |     |
}
The first line draws the face. The next three lines create a smaller rectangle
for the ears. We translate the rectangle up and left for the first ear, then to
| the | right | for the | second | ear.     | The    | result is shown | in    | Figure | ??.       |     |     |

Exercise C.3 In this exercise, you will draw “Moiré patterns” that seem
to shift around as you move. For an explanation of what is going on, see

| -------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- |
3. Modify the program so that the circles are drawn in the center of the
screen and concentric, as in Figure (left). The distance between the
??
circles should be small enough that the Moiré interference is apparent.

Debugging
Although there are debugging suggestions throughout the book, we thought
it would be useful to say more in an appendix. If you are having a hard time
debugging, you might want to review this appendix from time to time.
The best debugging strategy depends on what kind of error you have:
| •            |     | indicate | that there | is something | wrong with | the |
| ------------ | --- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | --- |
| Compile-time |     | errors   |            |              |            |     |
syntax of the program. Example: omitting the semicolon at the end of
a statement.
| •        |        | are produced | if something | goes wrong | while | the pro- |
| -------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| Run-time | errors |              |              |            |       |          |
gram is running. Example: an infinite recursion eventually causes a
StackOverflowError.
| •            | cause | the program      | to do the    | wrong thing. | Example: | an  |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------- | --- |
| Logic errors |       |                  |              |              |          |     |
| expression   | may   | not be evaluated | in the order | you expect.  |          |     |
The following sections are organized by error type; some techniques are useful
| for more than    | one type. |        |     |     |     |     |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D.1 Compile-Time |           | Errors |     |     |     |     |
The best kind of debugging is the kind you don’t have to do because you avoid
making errors in the first place. Incremental development, which we presented

| 330 |     |     |     |     |     | Appendix |     | D Debugging |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | ----------- |
in Section 4.9, can help. The key is to start with a working program and add
small amounts of code at a time. When there is an error, you will have a
| pretty | good | idea of where | it is. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---- | ------------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Nevertheless, you might find yourself in one of the following situations. For
| each situation, |          | we have    | some suggestions |       | about     | how | to proceed. |     |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----- | --------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
| The             | compiler | is spewing |                  | error | messages. |     |             |     |
If the compiler reports 100 error messages, that doesn’t mean there are 100
errors in your program. When the compiler encounters an error, it often gets
thrown off track for a while. It tries to recover and pick up again after the
| first error, | but | sometimes | it reports | spurious |     | errors. |     |     |
| ------------ | --- | --------- | ---------- | -------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
Only the first error message is truly reliable. We suggest that you fix only
one error at a time and then recompile the program. You may find that one
| semicolon   | or  | brace “fixes” | 100      | errors. |          |     |     |             |
| ----------- | --- | ------------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | --- | --- | ----------- |
| I’m getting |     | a weird       | compiler |         | message, |     | and | it won’t go |
away.
First of all, read the error message carefully. It may be written in terse jargon,
| but often | there | is a carefully | hidden | kernel | of  | information. |     |     |
| --------- | ----- | -------------- | ------ | ------ | --- | ------------ | --- | --- |
If nothing else, the message will tell you where in the program the problem
occurred. Actually, it tells you where the compiler was when it noticed a
problem, which is not necessarily where the error is. Use the information the
compiler gives you as a guideline, but if you don’t see an error where the
| compiler | is  | pointing, broaden |     | the search. |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Generally, the error will be prior to the location of the error message, but
in some cases it will be somewhere else entirely. For example, if you get an
error message at a method invocation, the actual error may be in the method
| definition | itself. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
If you don’t find the error quickly, take a breath and look more broadly at the
entire program. Make sure the program is indented properly; that makes it
| easier | to spot | syntax errors. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| D.1  | Compile-Time  |     | Errors     |        |         |     |     | 331 |
| ---- | ------------- | --- | ---------- | ------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Now, | start looking |     | for common | syntax | errors: |     |     |     |
1. Checkthatallparenthesesandbracketsarebalancedandproperlynested.
All method definitions should be nested within a class definition. All
|     | program | statements | should |     | be within | a method | definition. |     |
| --- | ------- | ---------- | ------ | --- | --------- | -------- | ----------- | --- |
2. Remember that uppercase letters are not the same as lowercase letters.
3. Check for semicolons at the end of statements (and no semicolons after
|     | curly braces). |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
4. Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks.
Make sure that you use double quotes for strings, and single quotes for
characters.
5. For each assignment statement, make sure that the type on the left is
the same as the type on the right. Make sure that the expression on the
left is a variable name or something else that you can assign a value to
|     | (like an | element | of an | array). |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
6. For each method invocation, make sure that the arguments you provide

|     | are invoking | the | method | on  | is the right | type. |     |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | ------ | --- | ------------ | ----- | --- | --- |
7. If you are invoking a value method, make sure you are doing something
with the result. If you are invoking a void method, make sure you are
|     | not trying | to  | do something |     | with the | result. |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | --- | ------------ | --- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- |
8. If you are invoking an instance method, make sure you are invoking it
on an object with the right type. If you are invoking a static method
from outside the class where it is defined, make sure you specify the class
|     | name (using | dot | notation). |     |     |     |     |     |

If the compiler says there is an error and you don’t see it, that might be
because you and the compiler are not looking at the same code. Check your
development environment to make sure the program you are editing is the
| program |     | the | compiler | is compiling. |     |     |     |     |     |     |

You might be editing one version of the file but compiling a different version.
If you are not sure, try putting an obvious and deliberate syntax error right
at the beginning of the program. Now compile again. If the compiler doesn’t
find the new error, there is probably something wrong with the way you set

If you have examined the code thoroughly, and you are sure the compiler is
compiling the right source file, it is time for desperate measures—debugging

by
• Make a backup of the file you are working on. If you are working on
|     | Bob.java, |     | make | a copy | called | Bob.java.old. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• Delete about half the code from Bob.java. Try compiling again.
If the program compiles now, you know the error is in the code you

If the program still doesn’t compile, the error must be in the code
–
that remains. Delete about half of the remaining code and repeat.
• Once you have found and fixed the error, start bringing back the code

Some error messages come with tidbits of advice, like “class Golfer must be
declared abstract. It does not define int compareTo(java.lang.Object) from

| ------------ | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
interface java.lang.Comparable.” It sounds like the compiler is telling you to
declare Golfer as an abstract class, and if you are reading this book, you
| probably | don’t | know what | that | is or how to | do it. |     |
| -------- | ----- | --------- | ---- | ------------ | ------ | --- |
Fortunately, the compiler is wrong. The solution in this case is to make sure
Golfer has a method called compareTo that takes an Object as a parameter.
Don’t let the compiler lead you by the nose. Error messages give you evidence
that something is wrong, but the remedies they suggest are unreliable.

It’s not always clear what causes a run-time error, but you can often figure
| things out | by  | adding print | statements | to your | program. |     |

| My program |     | hangs.       |            |         |          |     |
Ifaprogramstopsandseemstobedoingnothing, wesayitis“hanging”. Often
that means it is caught in an infinite loop or an infinite recursion.
• If you suspect that a particular loop is the problem, add a print state-
ment immediately before the loop that says "entering the loop" and
| another |     | immediately | after | that says "exiting | the loop". |     |
| ------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | ------------------ | ---------- | --- |
Run the program. If you get the first message and not the second,
you know where the program is getting stuck. Go to the section titled
| “Infinite |     | loop”. |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program to run for
a while and then produce a StackOverflowError. If that happens, go
| to  | the section | titled | “Infinite | recursion”. |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
If you are not getting a StackOverflowError, but you suspect there is
a problem with a recursive method, you can still use the techniques in
| the | infinite | recursion | section. |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | --------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
• If neither of the previous suggestions helps, you might not understand
the flow of execution in your program. Go to the section titled “Flow of
execution”.

| Infinite | loop |     |     |     |          |     |           |
If you think you have an infinite loop and you know which loop it is, add a
print statement at the end of the loop that displays the values of the variables
| in the | condition, | and | the value | of the condition. |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---------- | --- | --------- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- |
For example:
| while | (x                             | > 0 &&    | y < 0) | {   |        |          |        |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | --------- | ------ | --- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
|       | // do                          | something | to     | x   |        |          |        |
|       | // do                          | something | to     | y   |        |          |        |
|       | System.out.println("x:         |           |        | " + | x);    |          |        |
|       | System.out.println("y:         |           |        | " + | y);    |          |        |
|       | System.out.println("condition: |           |        |     | " + (x | > 0 && y | < 0)); |
}
Now when you run the program, you see three lines of output for each time
through the loop. The last time through the loop, the condition should be
false. If the loop keeps going, you will see the values of x and y, and you
| might    | figure out | why | they are | not getting | updated correctly. |     |     |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
| Infinite | recursion  |     |          |             |                    |     |     |
Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program to throw a
StackOverflowError. But if the program is slow, it may take a long time to
fill the stack.
If you know which method is causing an infinite recursion, check that there is a
base case. There should be a condition that makes the method return without
making a recursive invocation. If not, you need to rethink the algorithm and
| identify | a base | case. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
If there is a base case, but the program doesn’t seem to be reaching it, add a
print statement at the beginning of the method that displays the parameters.
Now when you run the program, you see a few lines of output every time
the method is invoked, and you can see the values of the parameters. If the
parameters are not moving toward the base case, you might see why not.

| Flow | of       | execution |     |        |     |     |     |     |     |
If you are not sure how the flow of execution is moving through your program,
add print statements to the beginning of each method with a message like
"entering method foo", where foo is the name of the method. Now when
you run the program, it displays a trace of each method as it is invoked.
You can also display the arguments each method receives. When you run the
program, check whether the values are reasonable, and check for one of the
| most | common |       | errors—providing |          |     | arguments | in the wrong  | order. |     |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | ---------------- | -------- | --- | --------- | ------------- | ------ | --- |
| When |        | I run | the              | program, |     | I get     | an exception. |        |     |
When an exception occurs, Java displays a message that includes the name
of the exception, the line of the program where the exception occurred, and
a stack trace. The stack trace includes the method that was running, the
method that invoked it, the method that invoked that one, and so on.
The first step is to examine the place in the program where the error occurred
| and | see | if you | can | figure | out what | happened: |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ------ | --- | ------ | -------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
NullPointerException:
You tried to access an instance variable or invoke a method on an object
that is currently null. You should figure out which variable is null and
|     | then | figure | out | how | it got | to be that | way. |     |     |
| --- | ---- | ------ | --- | --- | ------ | ---------- | ---- | --- | --- |
Remember that when you declare a variable with an array type, its
elementsareinitiallynulluntilyouassignavaluetothem. Forexample,
|     | this | code  | causes | a NullPointerException: |               |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ----------------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |      | int[] | array  | =                       | new Point[5]; |     |     |     |     |
System.out.println(array[0].x);
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
The index you are using to access an array is either negative or greater
than array.length - 1. If you can find the site where the problem is,
add a print statement immediately before it to display the value of the
index and the length of the array. Is the array the right size? Is the
|     | index | the | right | value? |     |     |     |     |     |

| 336 |     |     |     | Appendix | D Debugging |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | ----------- | --- |
Now work your way backward through the program and see where the
array and the index come from. Find the nearest assignment statement
and see if it is doing the right thing. If either one is a parameter, go
to the place where the method is invoked and see where the values are
| coming | from. |     |     |     |     |     |

FileNotFoundException:
This means Java didn’t find the file it was looking for. If you are using a
project-based development environment like Eclipse, you might have to
import the file into the project. Otherwise, make sure the file exists and
that the path is correct. This problem depends on your filesystem, so it
| can | be hard | to track | down. |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | -------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
ArithmeticException:
Something went wrong during an arithmetic operation; for example, di-
| vision  | by  | zero.      |            |                 |     |      |
| ------- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | --- | ---- |
| I added | so  | many print | statements | I get inundated |     | with |
output.
One of the problems with using print statements for debugging is that you can
end up buried in output. There are two ways to proceed: either simplify the
| output | or simplify | the program. |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
To simplify the output, you can remove or comment out print statements
that aren’t helping, or combine them, or format the output so it is easier to
understand. As you develop a program, you should write code to generate
| concise, | informative | traces | of what the program | is doing. |     |     |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------- | --------- | --- | --- |
To simplify the program, scale down the problem the program is working on.
For example, if you are sorting an array, sort a small array. If the program
takes input from the user, give it the simplest input that causes the error.
Also, clean up the code. Remove unnecessary or experimental parts, and
reorganize the program to make it easier to read. For example, if you suspect

| D.3 | Logic Errors |     |     |     |     |     | 337 |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
that the error is in a deeply nested part of the program, rewrite that part
with a simpler structure. If you suspect a large method, split it into smaller
| methods | and test | them | separately. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | -------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The process of finding the minimal test case often leads you to the bug. For
example, if you find that a program works when the array has an even number
of elements, but not when it has an odd number, that gives you a clue about
| what is | going | on. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Reorganizing the program can help you find subtle bugs. If you make a change
that you think doesn’t affect the program, and it does, that can tip you off.
| D.3        | Logic | Errors  |       |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| My program |       | doesn’t | work. |     |     |     |     |
Logic errors are hard to find because the compiler and interpreter provide
no information about what is wrong. Only you know what the program is
| supposed | to do, | and | only you | know that it | isn’t doing | it. |     |
| -------- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- | --- | --- |
The first step is to make a connection between the code and the behavior you
get. You need a hypothesis about what the program is actually doing. Here
| are some | questions | to  | ask yourself: |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | --------- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• Is there something the program was supposed to do that doesn’t seem to
be happening? Find the section of the code that performs that function,
and make sure it is executing when you think it should. See “Flow of
| execution” |     | on  | page ??. |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• Is something happening that shouldn’t? Find code in your program that
performs that function, and see if it is executing when it shouldn’t.
• Is a section of code producing an unexpected effect? Make sure you un-
derstand the code, especially if it invokes methods in the Java library.
Read the documentation for those methods, and try them out with sim-
| ple | test cases. |     | They might | not do what | you think | they do. |     |
| --- | ----------- | --- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | --- |

| 338 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | Appendix |     | D Debugging |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
To program, you need a mental model of what your code does. If it doesn’t
do what you expect, the problem might not actually be the program; it might
| be  | in your | head. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The best way to correct your mental model is to break the program into
components (usually the classes and methods) and test them independently.
Once you find the discrepancy between your model and reality, you can solve
the problem.
| Here | are | some common |     | logic | errors | to  | check | for: |     |     |     |
| ---- | --- | ----------- | --- | ----- | ------ | --- | ----- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
• Remember that integer division always rounds toward zero. If you want
fractions, use double. More generally, use integers for countable things
|     | and | floating-point |     | numbers |     | for measurable |     | things. |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | -------------- | --- | ------- | --- | -------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
• Floating-point numbers are only approximate, so don’t rely on them to
be perfectly accurate. You should probably never use the == operator
with doubles. Instead of writing if (d == 1.23), do something like
|     | if  | (Math.abs(d |     | -   | 1.23) | < .000001). |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | ----- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• When you apply the equality operator (==) to objects, it checks whether
they are identical. If you meant to check equivalence, you should use the
|     | equals | method |     | instead. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------ | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
• By default for user-defined types, equals checks identity. If you want a
|     | different | notion |     | of equivalence, |     | you | have | to override | it. |     |     |
| --- | --------- | ------ | --- | --------------- | --- | --- | ---- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
• Inheritance can lead to subtle logic errors, because you can run inherited
|      | code | without | realizing |     | it. See    | “Flow | of  | execution” | on page | ??.     |     |

| I’ve | got  | a big,  | hairy     |     | expression |       | and | it         | doesn’t | do what | I   |
expect.
Writing complex expressions is fine as long as they are readable, but they can
be hard to debug. It is often a good idea to break a complex expression into
| a   | series               | of assignments |     | to    | temporary      | variables: |     |                       |     |     |     |

|     |                      |                |     | (int) | Math.round(0.5 |            |     | * rect.getHeight())); |     |     |     |

| ------------------ | ---------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ----- | ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| This example       |            | can    | be rewritten            |       | as follows:         |     |     |     |     |
| double             | halfWidth  |        | =                       | 0.5 * | rect.getWidth();    |     |     |     |     |
| double             | halfHeight |        |                         | = 0.5 | * rect.getHeight(); |     |     |     |     |
| int                | dx =       | (int)  | Math.round(halfWidth);  |       |                     |     |     |     |     |
| int                | dy =       | (int)  | Math.round(halfHeight); |       |                     |     |     |     |     |
| rect.translate(dx, |            |        |                         | dy);  |                     |     |     |     |     |
The second version is easier to read, partly because the variable names provide
additional documentation. It’s also easier to debug, because you can check the
| types of | the temporary |     |     | variables | and | display their | values. |     |     |
| -------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --------- | --- | ------------- | ------- | --- | --- |
Another problem that can occur with big expressions is that the order of
operations may not be what you expect. For example, to evaluate x , you
2π
| might  | write this: |     |       |          |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ----------- | --- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| double | y           | = x | / 2 * | Math.PI; |     |     |     |     |     |
That is not correct, because multiplication and division have the same prece-
dence, and they are evaluated from left to right. This code computes xπ.

If you are not sure of the order of operations, check the documentation, or use

If you have a return statement with a complex expression, you don’t have a
| chance | to display    | the | value                  | before      | returning:    |       |              |     |     |

|        | return        | new | Rectangle(             |             |               |       |              |     |     |
|        | Math.min(a.x, |     |                        | b.x),       | Math.min(a.y, |       | b.y),        |     |     |
|        | Math.max(a.x  |     |                        | + a.width,  |               | b.x + | b.width)     |     |     |
|        |               | -   | Math.min(a.x,          |             | b.x)          |       |              |     |     |
|        | Math.max(a.y  |     |                        | + a.height, |               | b.y   | + b.height)  |     |     |
|        |               | -   | Math.min(a.y,          |             | b.y));        |       |              |     |     |

Instead of writing everything in one statement, use temporary variables:
|     | public | Rectangle |                 | intersection(Rectangle |                   |     | a, Rectangle     |       | b) {      |
| --- | ------ | --------- | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | --- | ---------------- | ----- | --------- |
|     |        | int x1    | = Math.min(a.x, |                        | b.x);             |     |                  |       |           |
|     |        | int y1    | = Math.min(a.y, |                        | b.y);             |     |                  |       |           |
|     |        | int x2    | = Math.max(a.x  |                        | + a.width,        |     | b.x + b.width);  |       |           |
|     |        | int y2    | = Math.max(a.y  |                        | + a.height,       |     | b.y + b.height); |       |           |
|     |        | Rectangle |                 | rect =                 | new Rectangle(x1, |     | y1, x2           | - x1, | y2 - y1); |
|     |        | return    | rect;           |                        |                   |     |                  |       |           |
}
Now you have the opportunity to display any of the intermediate variables
before returning. And by reusing x1 and y1, you made the code smaller too.
| My  | print | statement |     |     | isn’t doing | anything. |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | --------- | --- | --- | ----------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
If you use the println method, the output is displayed immediately, but if
you use print (at least in some environments), the output gets stored without
being displayed until the next newline. If the program terminates without
displaying a newline, you may never see the stored output. If you suspect that
this is happening, change some or all of the print statements to println.

First, get away from the computer for a few minutes. Computers emit waves
| that | affect        | the | brain, | causing | the following | symptoms: |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------------- | --- | ------ | ------- | ------------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
|      | • Frustration |     | and    | rage.   |               |           |     |     |     |
• Superstitious beliefs (“the computer hates me”) and magical thinking
|     | (“the  | program |        | works only | when I  | wear      | my hat backward”). |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
|     | • Sour | grapes  | (“this | program    | is lame | anyway”). |                    |     |     |
If you suffer from any of these symptoms, get up and go for a walk. When
you are calm, think about the program. What is it doing? What are possible
causes of that behavior? When was the last time you had a working program,
| and | what | did you | do  | next? |     |     |     |     |     |

Sometimes it just takes time to find a bug. People often find bugs when they
let their mind wander. Good places to find bugs are buses, showers, and bed.

It happens. Even the best programmers get stuck. Sometimes you need an-
other pair of eyes. Before you bring someone else in, make sure you have tried
| the | techniques | described | in  | this appendix. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---------- | --------- | --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Your program should be as simple as possible, and you should be working on
the smallest input that causes the error. You should have print statements in
the appropriate places (and the output they produce should be comprehensi-
ble). You should understand the problem well enough to describe it concisely.
When you bring someone in to help, give them the information they need:
|     | • What | kind of bug | is  | it? Compile-time, |     | run-time, | or logic? |     |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | --------- | --------- | --- |
• What was the last thing you did before this error occurred? What were
the last lines of code that you wrote, or what is the test case that fails?
• If the bug occurs at compile time or run time, what is the error message,
|     | and    | what part | of the | program  | does | it indicate? |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --------- | ------ | -------- | ---- | ------------ | --- | --- |
|     | • What | have you  | tried, | and what | have | you learned? |     |     |
By the time you explain the problem to someone, you might see the answer.
This phenomenon is so common that some people recommend a debugging
| technique |        | called “rubber   | ducking”. |        | Here’s | how it works: |     |     |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- |
|           | 1. Buy | a standard-issue |           | rubber | duck.  |               |     |     |
2. When you are really stuck on a problem, put the rubber duck on the
desk in front of you and say, “Rubber duck, I am stuck on a problem.
|     | Here’s      | what’s happening...” |       |               |       |     |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----- | ------------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | 3. Explain  | the problem          |       | to the rubber | duck. |     |     |     |
|     | 4. Discover | the solution.        |       |               |       |     |     |     |
|     | 5. Thank    | the rubber           | duck. |               |       |     |     |     |
We’re not kidding, it works! See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_
duck_debugging.

| I found | the bug! |     |          |             |
When you find the bug, the way to fix it is usually obvious. But not always.
Sometimes what seems to be a bug is really an indication that you don’t
understand the program, or your algorithm contains an error. In these cases,
you might have to rethink the algorithm or adjust your mental model. Take
some time away from the computer to think, work through test cases by hand,
| or draw diagrams | to represent | the computation. |     |     |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --- | --- |
After you fix the bug, don’t just start in making new errors. Take a minute to
think about what kind of bug it was, why you made the error, how the error
manifested itself, and what you could have done to find it faster. Next time
you see something similar, you will be able to find the bug more quickly. Or
| even better, | you will learn | to avoid that | type of bug | for good. |
